ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Firstl would like to thank Anna Biller, who helped edit and research this book, and whose in-

valuable insights played a critical role in the shape and content of 17w 48 Laws. Without her,
none of this would have been

possible.

I must also thank my dear friend Michiel Schwarz who was responsible for involving me in

the art school Fabrika in Italy and introducing me there to _]oost Elffers, my partner and producer
of The 48 Laws ofPower. It was in the scheming world of Fabrika that _]oost and I saw the timelessness of Machiavelli and from our discussions in Venice,
Italy, this book was born.
I would like to thank Henri Le Goubin, who supplied me with many Machiavellian anec~
dotes over the years, particularly conceming the numerous French characters who play such a

large role in this book.
I would also iike to thank Les and Sumiko Biller, who lent me their library on Japanese his-

tory and helped me with the Japanese Tea Ceremony part of the book. Similarly, I must thank
my good friend Elizabeth Yang who advised me on Chinese history.
A book like this depended greatly on the research material available andl am particularly

grateful to the UCLA Research Library; I spent many pleasant days wandering through its incomparable collections.
My parents, Laurette and Stanley Green, deserve endless thanks for their patience and
support.
And I must not forget to pay tribute to my cat, Boris, who kept me company throughout the

never—ending days of writing.
Finally, to those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game of power to manipu~
late, torture, and cause me pain over the years, I bear you no grudges and I thank you for sup
plying me with inspiration for The 48 Laws 0fP0wer.

NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER

Always make those above you feel comfortably superior In your desire to please or impress them, do not go
toofar in displaying your talent: or you might accomplish the oppasite~»—-inspire fear and insecurity. Make
your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights ofpower.
LAW 2

NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS,
LEARN HOW TO USE ENEMIES

Be wary :.3ffziends——~they will betray you more quickly, for they are easibr aroused to envy. 'I‘hey also become

spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more
to
prove. In fact, you have more to fearfromfriends than fitrm enemies. Ifyou have no enemies, find a way to
make them.

LAW 3

page 16

CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS

Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no
clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide themfar enough down the wrong path, envelop
them in enough smoke, and by the time thrgv realize your intentions, it will be too late.
LAW 4

page 31

ALVVAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY

When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more rommon you appear, and tlw less
in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open—ended,

and sphinxlike. Powerfltl people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you
are to say

somethingfoolish.
LAW 5

/mge37

SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION-—-GUARD IT WITH YOUR LIFE

Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win," once it slips,
however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be
akrt to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by

opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them.
LAVV 6

COURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST

Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing: Never let yourselfget lost in the
crowd, then, orburied in oblivion. Stand out. He conspicuous, at all cost. Malzeyourselfa magnet of attention

by appearing larger, more colorful more mysterious than the bland and timid masses.

GET OTHERS TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU, BUT ALWAYS TAKE THE CREDIT

Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own muse. Not only will such assistance save you valuable time and

energy, it will give you a godlike aura of ejficiertcy and speed. In the end

your hehpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you.

MAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU—-USE BAIT IF NECESSARY

When you forte the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent

INFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND UNLUCKY

You can die from someone else’: misery-——emotional states are as infectious as diseases. Km may feel you are

helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster: The unfortunate sometimes draw
misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.
LAW 1 1

page 82

LEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU

To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more

freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear.
Never touch them enough so that they can do without you.
LAVV 12 page 89

USE SELECTIVE HONESTY AND GENEROSITY TO DISARM YOUR VICTIM

One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. 0pen~hea7ted gestures of honesty and

gertemsity bring down the guard of even the most suspicions people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in
their armor; you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gzfl-ma ’}i‘q,v'an horse-——zoill serve the same
purpose.
LAW I 3

WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE’S SELFAINTEREST,
NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE

Ifyou need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him ofyour past assistance and good deeds. He
will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that

will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion, He will respond enthusiastically when he sees some-

thing to be gainedfor himself.

POSE AS A FRIEND, WORK AS A SPY

Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead.
Better still: Play the spy yourself In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people
to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an
opportunity finr artful spying.
LAW J5 page 107
CRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY

All great leaders since Adoses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely.

(Sometimes they

have learned this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventu-

ally break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover,
and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.
LAW 16

page 115

USE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR

Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you

appear If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked
about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.
LAW 17

page 1:23

KEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN AIR OF UNPREDICTABILITY

Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other peoples actions. Your pre-

dictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to
have no consistency or purpose will keep them off—balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain
your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.

DO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT YOURSELF—ISOLATION IS DANGEROUS

The world is dangerous and memies are everywhere——et/eryone has to protect themselves. A fortres.s seems the

safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you frorn—-—it cuts you offflom valuable information, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle.

KNOW WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH—DO NOT OFFEND THE WRONG PERSON

There are many different kinds ofpeople in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to
your strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives
seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs’ clothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then—
never

offend or deceive the wrong person.

RE-CREATE YOURSELF

Do not acvept the roles that society foists on you. Rmreate yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bones the audience. Be the master ofyour own image rather than letting others define it for you. Ineorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and octiom——your power will be
enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.

MAKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SEEM EFFORTLESS

Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also
all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act eflortlessly, as zfyou could do much more. Avoid the

CONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS YOU DEAL

The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in control,

them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of

PLAY TO PEOPLES FANTASIES

The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unjbleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are

preparedfor the anger that comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can

DISCOVER EACH MAN'S THUMBSCREW

Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable
emotion or need; it can also be a smafl secret pleasure. Either may, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn
to your advantage.
LAW 734 page 252
BE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASHION: ACT LIKE A KING TO BE TREATED LIKE ONE

The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make
people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By
acting regally and confident ofyour powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.

LAVV 33 page 291

MASTER THE ART OF TIMING

Never seem to be in a hurry—hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself: and over time. Always seem pa-

tient, as ifyou know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment;
out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power: Learn to stand back when the time is not yet
ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition.

LAVV 36 page 300

DISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM IS THE BEST REVENGE

By acknowledging a petgr problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy,
the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It
is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it.

CREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES

Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura ofpower—e1/eryone responds to them. Stage spectacles for those around you, then, full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence.

THINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS

If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways,

people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to
punish you for making them feel inferior It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your
originality onh with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.

STIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH

Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you
can

WORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS

Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You must seduce others into wanting to

DISARM AND INFURIATE WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT

The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for deception: When you mirror your enemies, doing ex~

actly as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror Eflect mocks and humiliates them, making
them overreact. By holding up a mirror to their psyehes, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their
values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror

PREACH THE NEED FOR CHANGE, BUT NEVER REFORM TOO MUCH AT ONCE

Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of
habit. Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. Ifyou are new to a position ofpower, or an

PREFACE

The feeling of having no power over people and events is generally unbearable to us«—-when we feel helpless we feel miserable. No one wants less
power; everyone wants more. In the world today, however, it is dangerous
to seem too power hungry, to be overt with your power moves. We have
to seem fair and decent. So we need to be subtle~—congenial yet cunning,

democratic yet devious.
This game of constant duplicity most resembles the power dynamic
that existed in the scheming world of the old aristocratic court. Throughout

history, a court has always formed itself around the person in power—king,
queen, emperor, leader. The courtiers who filled this court were in an especially delicate position: They had to serve their masters, but if they seemed
to fawn,

if they curried favor too obviously, the other courtiers around

them would notice and would act against them. Attempts to win the master’s favor, then, had to be subtle. And even skilled courtiers capable of
such subtlety still had to protect themselves from their fellow courtiers,
who at all moments were scheming to push them aside.
Meanwhile the court was supposed to represent the height of civilization and refinement. Violent or overt power moves were frowned upon;

couniers would work silently and secretly against any among them who

used force. This was the couxtier’s dilemma: While appearing the very
paragon of elegance, they had to outwit and thwart their own opponents in
the subtlest of ways. The successful comtier learned over time to make all
of his moves indirect; if he stabbed an opponent in the back, it was with a
velvet glove on his hand and the sweetest of smiles on his face. Instead of

using coercion or outright treachery, the perfect courtier got his way
through seduction, charm, deception, and subtle strategy, always planning
several moves ahead. Life in the court was a never-ending game that re-

quired constant vigilance and tactical thinking. It was civilized war.
Today we face a peculiarly similar paradox to that of the courtier:
Everything must appear civilized, decent, democratic, and fair. But if we
play by those rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed
by those around us who are not so foolish. As the great Renaissance diplomat and courtier Niccolo Machiavelli wrote,

“Any man who tries to be

good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who
are not

good.” The court imagined itself the pinnacle of refinement, but unPREFACE

respect the niceties, but inwardly, unless you are a fool, you learn quickly
to be
prudent, and to do as Napoleon advised: Place your iron hand inside

glove. If, like the courtier of times gone by, you can master the arts
of indirection, learning to seduce, charm, deceive, and subtly outmaneuver
your opponents, you will attain the heights of power. You will be able to
make people bend to your will without their realizing what you have done.

They utilize strategies that cleverly disguise the nature of the manipulation
involved. These types, for example, will often display their weakness and
lack of power as a kind of moral virtue. But true powerlessness, without
any motive of selfiinterest, would not publicize its weakness to gain sympa-

thy or respect. Making a show of one’s weakness is actually a very effective
strategy, subtle and deceptive, in the game of power (see Law 22, the Sur—
render Tactic).
Another strategy of the supposed nonplayer is to demand equality in
every area of life. Everyone must be treated alike, whatever their status and
strength. But to avoid the taint of power, you attempt to treat everyone

equally and fairly, you will confront the problem that some people do certain things better than others. Treating everyone equally means ignoring
their differences, elevating the less skillful and suppressing those who
excel. Again, many of those who behave this way are actually deploying
another power strategy, redistributing people’s rewards in a way that they
determine.
Yet another way of avoiding the game would be perfect honesty and

straightforwardness, since one of the main techniques of those who seek
power is deceit and secrecy. But being perfectly honest will inevitably hurt
and insult a great many people, some of whom will choose to injure you in
return. No one will see your honest statement as completely objective and
free of some personal motivation. And they will be right: In truth, the use
of honesty is indeed a power strategy, intended to convince people of one’s
noble, goodehearted, selfless character. It is a form of persuasion, even a
subtle form of coercion.

Finally, those who claim to be nonplayers may affect an air of naiveté,
to protect them from the accusation that they are after power. Beware

again, however, for the appearance of naiveté can be an effective means of
;1miii

PREFACE

deceit (see Law 21, Seem Dumber Than Your Mark). And even genuine
naiveté is not free of the snares of power. Children may be naive in many

ways, but they often act from an elemental need to gain control over those
around them. Children suffer greatly from feeling powerless in the adult

world, and they use any means available to get their way. Genuinely innocent people may still be playing for power, and are often horribly effective
at the game, since they are not hindered by reflection. Once again, those
who make a show or display of innocence are the least innocent of all.
You can recognize these supposed nonplayers by the way they flaunt
their moral qualities, their piety, their exquisite sense of justice. But since
all of us hunger for power, and almost all of our actions are aimed at gaining it, the nonplayers are merely throwing dust in our eyes, distracting us
from their power plays with their air of moral superiority. If you observe
them closely, you will see in fact that they are often the ones most skillful at
indirect manipuiation, even if some of them practice it unconsciously. And
they greatly resent any publicizing of the tactics they use every day.
If the world is like a giant scheming court and we are trapped inside it,
there is no use in trying to opt out of the game. That will only render you
powerless, and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead of struggling against the inevitable, instead of arguing and whining and feeling
guilty, it is far better to excel at power. In fact, the better you are at dealing
with power, the better friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you be
come. By following the route of the perfect courtier (see Law 24) you learn
to make others feel better about themselves, becoming a source of pleasure
to them. They will grow dependent on your abilities and desirous of your
presence. By mastering the 48 laws in this book, you spare others the pain
that comes from bungling with power—~by playing with fire without knowing its properties. If the game of power is inescapable, better to be an artist
than 2. denier or a bungler.

Learning the game of power requires a certain way of looking at the world,
a shifting of perspective. It takes effort and years of practice, for much of
the game may not come naturally. Certain basic skills are required, and
once
you master these skills you will be able to apply the laws of power
more easily.
The most important of these skills, and power’s crucial foundation, is
the ability to master your emotions. An emotional response to a. situation is
the single greatest barrier to power, a mistake that will cost you a lot more
than any temporary satisfaction you might gain by expressing your feelings. Emotions cloud reason, and if you cannot see the situation clearly,
you cannot prepare for and respond to it with any degree of control.
Anger is the most destructive of emotional responses, for it clouds
your vision the most. It also has a ripple effect that invariably makes situations less controllable and heightens your enemy’s resolve. If you are try»
ing to destroy an enemy who has hurt you, far better to keep him off—guard
by feigning friendliness than showing your anger.

Related to mastering your emotions is the ability to distance yourself
from the present moment and think objectively about the past and future.
Like Janus, the double—faced Roman deity and guardian of all gates and

doorways, you must be able to look in both directions at once, the better to
handle danger from wherever it comes. Such is the face you must create for
yourself-one face looking continuously to the future and the other to the
P ast.
For the future, the motto is, “No days unalert.” Nothing should catch
you by surprise because you are constantly imagining problems before
they arise. Instead of spending your time dreaming of your plan’s happy

ending, you must work on calculating every possible permutation and pitfall that might emerge in it. The further you see, the more steps ahead you
plan, the more powerful you become.
The other face of Janus looks constantly to the past—though not to remember past hurts or bear grudges. That would only curb your power.
Half of the game is learning how to forget those events in the past that eat
away at you and cloud your reason. The real purpose of the backward-

glancing eye is to educate yourself constantly—you look at the past to learn
from those who came before you. (The many historical examples in this
book will greatly help that process.) Then, having looked to the past, you
look closer at hand, to your own actions and those of your friends. This is
the most vital school you can learn from, because it comes from personal

experience.
You begin by examining the mistakes you have made in the past, the
ones that have most
grievously held you back. You analyze them in terms

again.” If you can evaluate and observe yourself in this way, you can learn
to break the patterns of the past—an immensely valuable skill.
Power requires the ability to play with appearances. To this end you
must learn to wear many masks and keep a bag full of deceptive tricks. Deception and masquerade should not be seen as ugly or immoral. All human
interaction requires deception on many levels, and in some ways what sep—
arates humans from animals is our ability to lie and deceive. In Greek
myths, in India’s Mahabharata cycle, in the Middle Eastern epic of Gilga~
mesh, it is the privilege of the gods to use deceptive arts; a great man,
Odysseus for instance, was judged by his ability to rival the craftiness of the
gods, stealing some of their divine power by matching them in wits and deception. Deception is a developed art of civilization and the most potent
weapon in the game of power.

PREFACE

You cannot succeed at deception unless you take a somewhat distanced approach to yourself——-unless you can be many different people,

wearing the mask that the day and the moment require. With such a flexi«
ble approach to all appearances, including your own, you lose a lot of the
inward heaviness that holds people down. Make your face as malleable as

the actor’s, work to conceal your intentions from others, practice luring

people into traps. Playing with appearances and mastering arts of decep
tion are among the aesthetic pleasures of life. They are also key compo«
nents in the acquisition of power.

If deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience
in all things is your crucial shield. Patience will protect you from making
moronic blunders, Like mastering your emotions, patience is

more

godlike than anything in the natural world. And patience is the

supreme virtue of the gods, who have nothing but time. Everything good
will happen——-the grass will grow again, if you give it time and see several

steps into the future. Impatience, on the other hand, only makes you look
weak. It is a. principal impediment to power.
Power is essentially amoral and one of the most important skills to ac~

quire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil. Power is a

What does it matter if another player, your friend or rival, intended good

things and had only your interests at heart, if the effects of his action lead to
so much min and confusion? It is
only natural for people to cover up their
actions with all kinds of justifications, always assuming that they have acted
out of goodness. You must learn to inwardly laugh each time you hear this
and never get caught up in gauging someone’s intentions and actions
through a set of moral judgments that are really an excuse for the accumulation of power.
It is a game. Your opponent sits opposite you. Both of you behave as
gentlemen or ladies, observing the rules of the game and taking nothing
personally. You play with a strategy and you observe your opponent’s
moves with as much

calmness as you can muster. In the end, you will apthe

Half of your mastery of power comes from what you do not do, what
you do not allow yourself to get dragged into. For this skill you must learn
to judge all things by what they cost you. As Nietzsche wrote, “The value of

thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays
for it——what it costs us.” Perhaps you will attain your goal, and a worthy goal

others—that is too high a price to pay.

Power is a social game. To learn and master it, you must develop the
ability to study and understand people. As the great seventeenth-century
thinker and courtier Baltasar Gracién wrote: “Many people spend time
studying the properties of animals or herbs; how much more important it
would be to study those of people, with whom we must live or die!” To be a
master player you must also be a master psychologist. You must recognize
motivations and see through the cloud of dust with which people surround
their actions. An understanding of people’s hidden motives is the single
greatest piece of knowledge you can have in acquiring power. It opens up
endless possibilities of deception, seduction, and manipulation.
People are of infinite complexity and you can spend a lifetime watchthem
without ever fully understanding them. So it is all the more iming
portant, then, to begin your education now. In doing so you must also keep
one
principle in mind: Never discriminate as to whom you study and
whom you trust. Never trust anyone completely and study everyone, including friends and loved ones.
Finally, you must learn always to take the indirect route to power. Dis-

guise your cunning. Like a billiard ball that caroms several times before it
hits its target, your moves must be planned and developed in the least ob
vious way. By training yourself to be indirect, you can thrive in the modern
court, appearing the paragon of decency while being the consummate ma-

nipulator.
Consider The 48 Laws of Power a kind of handbook on the arts of indirec»
tion. The laws are based on the writings of men and women who have

studied and mastered the game of power. These writings span a period of
more

than three thousand years and were created in civilizations as dis»

parate as ancient China and Renaissance Italy; yet they share common
threads and themes, together hinting at an essence of power that has yet to
be fully articulated. The 48 laws of power are the distillation of this accu-

mulated wisdom, gathered from the writings of the most illustrious strate

gists (Sun-tzu, Clausewitz), statesmen (Bismarck, Talleyrand), courtiers
(Castiglione, Gracién), seducers (Ninon de Lenclos, Casanova), and con
artists (“Yellow Kid” Weil) in history.
The laws have a simple premise: Certain actions almost always increase one’s power (the observance of the law), while others decrease it
and even ruin us (the transgression of the law). These transgressions and
observances are illustrated by historical examples. The laws are timeless
and definitive.

T7ze 48 Laws ofPower can be used in several ways. By reading the book
straight through you can learn about power in general. Although several of
the laws may seem not to pertain directly to your life, in time you will

are interrelated. By getting an overview of the entire
subject you will best

The book has also been designed for browsing and for examining the

Finally, the book can be browsed through and picked apart for entertainrnent. for an enjoyable ride through the foibles and great deeds of our

this purpose: It might be better to tum back. Power is endlessly seductive
and deceptive in its own way. It is a 1abyrinth—your mind becomes consumed with solving ifs infinite problems, and you soon realize how pleasantly lost you have become. In other words, it becomes most amusing by
taking it seriously. Do not be frivolous with such a critical matter. The gods
of power frown on the frivolous; they give ultimate satisfaction only to

TRANSCRESSION OF THE LAW
Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV’s finance minister in the first years of his reign,
generous man who loved lavish parties, pretty women, and poetry.
He also loved money, for he led an extravagant lifestyle. Fouquet was

was a

clever and very much indispensable to the king, so when the prime mim's—
ter, Jules Mazarin, died, in 1661, the finance minister expected to be
named the successor. Instead, the king decided to abolish the position. This
and other signs made Fouquet suspect that he was falling out of favor, and
so he decided to
ingraliate himself with the king by staging the most spectacular party the world had ever seen. The party’s ostensible purpose
would be to commemorate the completion of Fouquet’s chateau, Vaux—le-

Vicomte, but its real function was to pay tribute to the king, the guest of
honor.
The most brilliant nobility of Europe and some of the greatest minds
of the Iime—La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Sévigné—
attended the party. Moliere wrote a play for the occasion, in which he

himself was to perform at the evening’s conclusion. The party began with a
lavish

seven—course

dinner, featuring foods from the Orient never be-

fore tasted in France, as well as new dishes created especially for the night.
The meal

was

accompanied with music commissioned by Fouquet to

honor the king.
After dinner there was a promenade through the chateau’s gardens.
The grounds and fountains of Vaux—le»Vicomte were to be the inspiration
for Versailles.

Fouquet personally accompanied the young king through the geometrically aligned arrangements of shrubbery and flower beds. Arriving at the
gardens’ canals, they witnessed a fireworks display, which was followed by
the performance of Moliere’s play. The party ran well into the night and
everyone agreed it was the most amazing affair they had ever attended.
The next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king’s head musketeer,
D’Artagna.n. Three months later he went on trial for stealing from the
country’s treasury. (Actually, most of the stealing he was accused of he had
done on the kings behalf and with the king’s permission.) Fouquet was
found guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in the
Pyrenees Mountains, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in solitary confinement.

Interpretation
Louis XIV, the Sun King, was a proud and arrogant man who wanted to be

the center of attention at all times; he could not countenance being outdone in lavishness by anyone, and certainly not his finance minister. To
succeed Fouquet, Louis chose _]ean—Baptiste Colbert, a man famous for his

parsimony and for giving the dullest parties in Paris. Colbert made sure
that any money liberated from the treasury went straight into Louis’s
hands. With the money, Louis built a palace even more magnificent than

Fouquet’s—the glorious palace of Versailles. He used the same architects,
9

LAW 1

decorators, and garden designer. And at Versailles, Louis hosted parties
even more
extravagant than the one that cost Fouquet his freedom.
Let us examine the situation. The evening of the party, as Fouquet presented spectacle on spectacle to Louis, each more magnificent than the one
before, he imagined the affair as demonstrating his loyalty and devotion to
the king. Not only did he think the party would put him back in the king’s
favor, he thought it would show his good taste, his connections, and his

popularity, making him indispensable to the king and demonstrating that
he would make an excellent prime minister. Instead, however, each new
spectacle, each appreciative smile bestowed by the guests on Fouquet,
made it seem to Louis that his own friends and subjects were more
charmed by the finance minister than by the king himself, and that Fouquet
was
actually flauming his wealth and power. Rather than flattering Louis
XXV, Fouquet’s elaborate party offended the king’s vanity. Louis would not
admit this to anyone, of course-—-instead, he found a convenient excuse to
rid himself of a man who had inadvertently made him feel insecure.

Such is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who unbalance the
master’s sense of self, poke holes in his vanity, or make him doubt his pro
eminence.

When the wming began, Fouquet was at the to}: of the world.

By the time it had ended, he was at the bottom.
Voltaire, 16.944 778

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the

early 1600s, the Italian astronomer and mathematician Galileo

found himself in a precarious position. He depended on the generosity of

great rulers to support his research, and so, like all Renaissance scientists,
he would sometimes make gifts of his inventions and discoveries to the

leading patrons of the time. Once, for instance, he presented a militaiy
compass he had invented to the Duke of Gonzaga. Then he dedicated a
book explaining the use of the compass to the Medicis. Both rulers were

grateful, and through them Galileo was able to find more students to teach.
No matter how great the discovery, however, his patrons usually paid him
with gifts, not cash. This made for a life of constant insecurity and dependence. There must be an easier way, he thought.
Galileo hit on a new strategy in l6l0, when he discovered the moons
of Jupiter. Instead of dividing the discovery among his patrons—giving
one the

telescope he had used, dedicating a book to another, and so on—as

he had done in the past, he decided to focus exclusively on the Medicis. He
chose the Medicis for one reason: Shortly after Cosimo I had established

the Medici dynasty, in 1540, he had made Jupiter, the mightiest of the
gods, the Medici symbol—a symbol of a. power that went beyond politics
and banking, one linked to ancient Rome and its divinities.
Galileo turned his discovery of _]upiter’s moons into a cosmic event

LAW 1

33

honoring the Medicis’ greatness. Shortly after the discovery, he announced
that “the bright stars [the moons of jupiterl offered themselves in the heav~
ens” to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo II’s enthronement. He
said that the number of the moons-—-four——harmonized with the number of
the Medicis (Cosimo II had three brothers) and that the moons orbitecl

Jupiter as these four sons revolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty’ s founder.
More than coincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected

the ascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to
the Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representing Jupiter sitting
on a

cloud with the four stars circling about him, and presented this to

Cosimo II as a symbol of his link to the stars.
In 1610 Cosimo II made Galileo his official court philosopher and

mathematician, with a full salary. For a scientist this was the coup of a life»
time. The days of begging for patronage were over.

Interpretation
In one stroke, Galileo gained more with his new strategy than he had in

years of begging. The reason is simple: All masters want to appear more
brilliant than other people.

They do not care about science or empirical tmth or the latest inven~
tion; they care about their name and their glory. Galileo gave the Medicis
infinitely more glory by linking their name with cosmic forces them he had
by making them the patrons of some new scientific gadget or discovery.
Scientists are not spared the vagaries of court life and patronage. They
too must serve masters who hold the purse strings. And their great intellectual powers can make the master feel insecure, as if he were only there to
supply the funds~—an ugly, ignoble job. The producer of a great work
wants to feel he is more than just the provider of the financing. He wants to
appear creative and powerful, and also more important than the work pro~
duoed in his name. Instead of insecurity you must give him glory. Galileo
did not challenge the intellectual authority of the Medicis with his discov~
ery, or make them feel inferior in any way; by literally aligning them with
the stars, he made them shine brilliantly among the courts of Italy. He did
not outshine the master, he made the master outshine all others.

KEYS TO POWER

Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and display your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment, envy, and
other manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend
your life worrying about the petty feelings of others. With those above you,
however, you must take a different approach: When it comes to power,
outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of all.
Do not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the
days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high standing in life
are like
kings and queens: They want to feel secure in their positions, and

-1’

LAW]
,

superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is a. deadly
but common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting
your gifts and talents, you are winning the master’s affection. He may feign
appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone

less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced
the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will
not admit the tmth, but will find an excuse to rid himself of your presence.

This Law involves two rules that you must realize, First, you can inad-

vertently outshine a master simply by being yourself. There are masters
who are more insecure than others, nronstrously insecure; you may naturally outshine them by your charm and grace.
No one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of

Faenza. The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he captivated

his subjects with his generosity and open spirit.
In the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. When the city
surrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia, who,
however, decided to spare the town: He simply occupied its fortress, executed none of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi, eighteen at the

time, to remain with his court, in complete freedom.
A few weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi away to a
Roman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of the River
Tiber, a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the horrible deed with

Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do

anything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites who fell
out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine. In
late-sixteentbcenturyjapan, the favorite of Emperor Hideyoshi was a man
called Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the tea ceremony, which had become an obsession with the
nobility, he was one of Hideyoshi’s most
trusted advisers, had his own apartment in the palace, and was honored
throughout japan. Yet in 1591, Hideyoshi had him arrested and sentenced
to death. Rikyu took his own life, instead. The cause for his sudden change
of fortune was discovered later: It seems that Rikyu, former peasant and
later court favorite, had had a wooden statue made of himself wearing san-

dals (a Sign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in
the most important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the roy-

alty who often would pass by. To Hidcyoshi this signified that Rikyu had
no sense of limits.

Knowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can turn this Law
to your advantage. First you must flatter and puff up your master. Overt
flattery can be effective but has its limits; it is too direct and obvious, and
looks bad to other courtiers. Discreet flattery is much more powerful. If
you are more intelligent than your master, for example, seem the opposite:
Make him appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem that
you need his expertise. Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in
the long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore
such requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the

him, in as public a manner as possible. Make it clear that your advice is

If you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the court

jester, but do not make him appear cold and surly by comparison. Tone
down your humor if necessary, and find ways to make him seem the dispenser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more sociable
and generous than your master, be careful not to be the cloud that blocks
his radiance from others. He must appear as the sun around which every-

revolves, radiating power and brilliance, the center of attention. If you
are thrust into the
position of entertaining him, a display of your limited

may win you his sympathy. Any attempt to impress him with your

In all of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if
in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain
in control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity. This will all come in

handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo,
you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you
are a
godsend and you will be instantly promoted.

Michael had been Michael’s uncle, Bardas, a man of intelligence and a:mbi~

triguers, murderers, and profligates. In this time of peril he needed
someone he could trust as his councillor, and his thoughts turned to Basil~

loaded his friend with gifts and favors and they became inseparable. Basilius was sent to the finest school in Byzantium, and the crude peasant be—

sophisticated courtier.

Now Michael was emperor, and in need of someone loyal. Who could
better
trust with the post of chamberlain and chief councillor than a
he
young man who owed him everything?
Basilius could be trained for the job and Michael loved him like a
brother. Ignoring the advice of those who recommended the much more

qualified Bardas, Michael chose his friend.
Basilius learned well and was soon advising the emperor on all matters
of state. The only problem seemed to be money-——Basilius never had
enough. Exposure to the splendor of Byzantine court life made him avaricious for the perks of power. Michael doubled, then tripled his salary, ennobled him, and married him off to his own mistress, Eudoxia Ingerina.
Keeping such a trusted friend and adviser satisfied was worth any price.
But more trouble was to come. Bardas was now head of the army, and

Basilius convinced Michael mat the man was hopelessly ambitious. Under
the illusion that he could control his nephew, Bardas had conspired to put
him on the throne, and he could conspire again, this time to get rid of

him to death. Soon after, Basilius asked that he replace Bardas as head of
the army, where he could keep control of the realm and quell rebellion.
This was granted.
Now Basilius’s power and wealth only grew, and a few years later

Michael, in financial straits from his own extravagance, asked him to pay
back some of the money he had borrowed over the years. To Michael’s
shock and astonishment, Basilius refused, with a look of such impudence

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
For several centuries after the fall of the Han Dynasty {A.D. 222}, Chinese his-

tory followed the same pattern of violent and bloody coups, one after the
other. Army men would plot to kill a weak emperor, then would replace him
on

the Dragon Throne with a strong general. The general would start a new

dynasty and crown himself emperor; to ensure his own survival he would kill
off his fellow generals. A few years later, however, the pattern would resume:
New generals would rise up and assassinate him or his sons in their turn. To
be emperor of China was to be alone, surrounded by a pack of enemies—it
was the least
powerful, least secure position in the realm.
In A.D. 959, General Chao K’uang—yin became Emperor Sung. He
knew the adds, the probability that within a year or two he would be murdered; how could he break the pattern? Soon after becoming emperor,
Sung ordered a banquet to celebrate the new dynasty, and invited the most
powerful commanders in the army. After they had drunk much wine, he

feared he would murder them in one fell swoop. Instead, he addressed
them: “The whole day is spent in fear, and I am unhappy both at the table

and in my bed. For which one of you does not dream of ascending the

wise prince ought,

throne? I do not doubt your allegiance, but if by some chance your subor-

dinates, seeking wealth and position, were to force the emperor’s yellow
robe upon you in turn, how could you refuse it?” Drunk and tearing for
their lives, the generals proclaimed their innocence and their loyalty. But

Sung had other ideas: “The best way to pass one’s days is in peaceful en~
joyment of riches and honor. If you are willing to give up your commands,
I am ready to provide you with line estates and beautiful dwellings where
you may take your pleasure with singers and girls as your companions.”
The astonished generals realized that instead of a life of anxiety and
struggle Sung was offering them riches and security. The next day, all of
the generals tendered their resignations, and they retired as nobles to the
estates that Sung bestowed on them.
In one stroke, Sung turned a pack of “friendly” wolves, who would
likely have betrayed him, into a group of docile lambs, fax from all power.
Over the next few years Sung continued his campaign to secure his
rule. In A.D. 971, King Lin of the Southern Han finally surrendered to him
after years of rebellion. To Liu’s astonishment, Sung gave him a rank in the
imperial court and invited him to the palace to seal their newfound friendship with wine. As King Liu took the glass that Sung offered him, he hesitated, fearing it contained poison. “Your subject’s crimes certainly merit
death,” he cried out, “but I beg Your Majesty to spare your subject’s life. Indeed I dare not drink this wine.” Emperor Sung laughed, took the glass
from Lin, and swallowed it himself. There was no poison. From then on
Liu became his most trusted and loyal friend.
At the time, China had splintered into many smaller kingdoms. When
Ch’ien Shu, the king of one of these, was defeated, Sung’s ministers advised the emperor to lock this rebel up. They presented documents proving that he was still conspiring to kill Sung. When Ch’ien Shu came to visit
the emperor, however, instead of locking him up, Sung honored him. He
also gave him a package, which he told the former king to open when he
was
halfway home. Ch’ien Shu opened the bundle on his return journey
and saw that it contained all the papers documenting his conspiracy. He realized that Sung knew of his murderous plans, yet had spared him nonetheless. This generosity won him over, and he too became one of Sung’s most
loyal vassals.

A Chinese proverb compares friends to the jaws and teeth of a dangerous
animal: If you are not careful, you will find them chewing you up. Emperor
Sung knew the jaws he was passing between when he assumed the throne:
His “friends” in the army would chew him up like meat, and if he some-

Emperor Sung would have no truck with “friends”—-he bribed his fellow
generals with splendid estates and kept them far away. This was a much
better way to emasculate them than killing them, which would only have
led other generals to seek vengeance. And Sung would have nothing to do
with “friendly” ministers. More often than not, they would end up drinking
his famous cup of poisoned wine.
Instead of relying on friends, Sung used his enemies, one after the
other, transforming them into far more reliable subjects. While a friend expects more and more favors, and seethes with jealousy, these former £:ne~
mies expected nothing and got everything. A man suddenly spared the
guillotine is a grateful man indeed, and will go to the ends of the earth for
the man who has pardoned him. In time, these former enemies became
Sung’ s most trusted friends.
And Sung was finally able to break the pattern of coups, violence, and
civil war—the Sung Dynasty ruled China for more than three hundred
years.

friend at hand?
The problem is that you often do not know your friends as well as you

imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument.

They cover up their unpleasant qualifies so as to not offend each other.
They laugh extra hard at each other’s jokes. Since honesty rarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend tmly feels. Friends will
say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in
clothes———maybe they mean it, often they do not.
When you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the qualities
he or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of kindness that
unbalances everything. People want to feel they deserve their good fortune. The receipt of a favor can become oppressive: It means you have
been chosen because you are a friend, not necessarily because you are do

serving. There is almost a touch of condescension in the act of hiring
friends that secretly afflicts them. The injury will come out slowly: A little
more
honesty, flashes of resentment and envy here and there, and before
you know it your friendship fades. The more favors and gifts you supply to
revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive.

derestimate them. Better to be wary. If you never expect gratitude from a
friend, you will be pleasantly surprised when they do prove grateful.
The problem with using or hiring friends is that it will inevitably limit
your power. The friend is rarely the one who is most able to help you; and
in the end, skill and competence are far more important than friendly feel-

ings. (Michael Ill had a man right under his nose who would have steered
him right and kept him alive: That man was Bardas.)

Finally, he knew that his relationship with Fouché would be based on mutual selfiinterest, and would not be contaminated by personal feeling. The
selection proved perfect; although the conspirators did not succeed in toppling Napoleon, the union of such powerful but unlikely partners generated much interest in the cause; opposition to the emperor slowly began to
spread. And from then on, Talleyi-and and Fouché had a. fruitful working
relationship. Whenever you can, bury the hatchet with an enemy, and
make a point of putting him in your service.
As Lincoln said, you destroy an enemy when you make a friend of
him. In 1971, during the Vietnam War, Henry Kissinger was the target of
an unsuccessful
kidnapping attempt, a conspiracy involving, among others,
the renowned antiwar activist priests the Berrigan brothers, four more
Catholic priests, and four nuns. In private, without informing the Secret
Service or the justice Department, Kissinger arranged a Saturday-morning
meeting with three of the alleged kidnappers. Explaining to his guests that
he would have most American soldiers out of Vietnam by mid-1972, he
completely charmed them. They gave him some “Kidnap Kissinger” but»
tons and one of them remained a friend of his for years,
visiting him on
several occasions. This was not just 8. onetime ploy: Kissinger made a policy of working with those who disagreed with him. Colleagues commented

then, to use enemies as enemies rather than transforming them into friends
or allies.

Mao Tse-tung saw conflict as key in his approach to power. In 1937 the

Japanese invaded China, i.nte.rrupi:i:ug the aim‘! war between Mods Communists and their enemy, the Nationalists.

Fearing that the Japanese would wipe them out, some Communist
leaders advocated leaving the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, and using
the time to recuperate. Mao disagreed: The Japanese could not possibly

defeat and occupy a vast country like China for long. Once they left, the

Communists would have grown rusty if they had been out of combat for
several years, and would be ill prepared to reopen their struggle with the
Nationalists. To fight a formidable foe like the Japanese, in fact, would be

the perfect training for the Communists’ ragtag army. Mao’s plan was
adopted, and it worked: By the time the Japanese finally retreated, the
Communists had gained the fighting experience that helped them defeat
the Nationalists.
Years later, aJapanese visitor tried to apologize to Mao for his coun-

try’s invasion of China. Mao interrupted, “Should I not thank you in»
stead?” Without a worthy opponent, he explained, a man or group cannot
grow stronger.
Mao’s strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First,
be certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a

fight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the
Japanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no apparent enemies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even turning a friend
into an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in politics. Third, use
such enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing
it as a struggle of good against evil. Mao actually encouraged Chi.na’s dis

agreements with the Soviet Union and the United States; without clear-cut
enemies, he believed, his people would lose any sense of what Chinese
Communism meant A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument
for your side than all the words you could possibly put together.
Never let the presence of enemies upset or distress you—you are far
better off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your
real enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to

enhance his reputation as a surefoobed fighter who can be relied upon in
times of uncertainty.

REVE RSA L

Although it is generally best not to mix work with friendship, there are
times when a friend can be used to greater effect than an enemy. A man of

power, for example, often has dirty work that has to be done, but for the
sake of appearances it is generally preferable to have other people do it for

him; friends often do this the best, since their afiection for him makes them
willing to take chances. Also, if your plans go awry for some reason, you
can use a friend as a convenient
scapegoat. This “fall of the favorite” was a
trick often used by kings and sovereigns: They would let their closest friend
at court take the fall for a mistake, since the public would not believe that

they would deliberately sacrifice a friend for such a purpose. Of course,
after you play that card, you have lost your friend forever. It is best, then, to
reserve

the scapegoat role for someone who is close to you but not too

close.

Finally, the problem about working with friends is that it confuses the
boundaries and distances that working requires. But if both partners in the

arrangement understand the dangers involved, a friend often can be employed to great effect. You must never let your guard down in such a venture, however; always be on the lookout for any signs of emotional
disturbance such as envy and ingratitude. Nothing is stable in the realm of
power, and even the closest of friends can be transformed into the worst of
enernies.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Over several weeks, Ninon de Lenclos, the most infamous courtesan of

seventeentlrcentury France, listened patiently as the Marquis de Sevigné
explained his struggles in pursuing a beautiful but difficult young countess.
N inon was sixty~two at the time, and more than experienced in matters of
love; the marquis was a lad of twenty-two, handsome, dashing, but hope
lessly inexperienced in romance. At first Ninon was amused to hear the
marquis talk about his mistakes, but finally she had had enough. Unable to
bear ineptitude in any realm, least of all in seducing a woman, she decided
to take the young man under her wing. First, he had to understand that this
was

war, and that the beautiful countess was {citadel to which he had to

lay siege as carefully as any general. Every step had to be planned and executed with the utmost attention to detail and nuance.

Instructing the marquis to start over, Ninon told him to approach the
countess with a bit of distance, an air of nonchalance. The next time the
two were alone

together, she said, he would confide in the countess as

would a friend but notva potential lover. This was to throw her off the scent.
The countess was no longer to take his interest in her for granted-perhaps
he was only interested in friendship.

Ninon planned ahead. Once the countess was confused, it would be
time to make her jealous. At the next encounter, at a major féte in Paris, the

marquis would show up with a beautiful young woman at his side. This
beautiful young woman had equally beautiful friends, so that wherever the
countess would now see the marquis, he would be surrounded by the most
stunning young women in Paris. Not only would the countess be seething
with jealousy, she would come to see the marquis as someone who was desired by others. It was hard for Ninon to make the marquis understand, but
she patiently explained that a woman who is interested in a man wants to
see

that other women are interested in him, too. Not only does that give

him instant value, it makes it all the more satisfying to snatch him from

their clutches.
Once the countess was jealous but intrigued, it would be time to beguile her. On Ninon’s instructions, the marquis would fail to show up at affairs where the countess expected to see him. Then, suddenly, he would
appear at salons he had never frequented before, but that the countess at-

LAW 3

I7

tended often. She would be unable to predict his moves. All of this would

push her into the state of emotional confusion that is a prerequisite for sum
cessful seduction.
These moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon monitored the marquis’s progress: Through her network of spies, she heard how
the countess would laugh a little harder at his witticisms, listen more

closely to his stories. She heard that the countess was suddenly asking questions about him. Her friends told her that at social affairs the countess

would often look up at the marquis, following his steps. Ninon felt certain
that the young woman was falling under his spell. It was a matter of weeks
now,

maybe a month or two, but if all went smoothly, the citadel would

fall.
A few days later the marquis was at the countess’s home. They were
alone. Suddenly he was a different man: This time acting on his own im—

pulse, rather than following Ninon’s instructions, he took the countess’s
hands and told her he was in love with her. The young woman seemed

confused, 3 reaction he did not expect. She became polite, then excused
herself. For the rest of the evening she avoided his eyes, was not there to

say goodnight to him. The next few times he visited he was told she was
finally admitted him again, the two felt awkward

not at home. When she

and uncomfortable with each other. The spell was broken.

Interpretation
Ninon de Lenclos knew everything about the art of love. The greatest writers, thinkers, and

politicians of the time had been her lovers——men like La

Rochefoucauld, Moliére, and Richelieu. Seduction was a game to her, to be
practiced with skill. As she got older, and her reputation grew, the most im~
portant families in France would send their sons to her to be instructed in
matters of love.

Ninon knew that men and women are very different, but when it
comes to seduction

they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often sense

when they are being seduced, but they give in because they enjoy the feel-

ing of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other person to detour
you into a strange country. Everything in seduction,
however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce your intentions or
reveal them directly in words. Instead you must throw your targets off the
scent. To surrender to your

guidance they must be appropriately confused.

You have to scramble your signals——~appea.r interested in another man or

(the decoy), then hint at being interested in the target, then feign
indifference, on and on. Such patterns not only confuse, they excite.
Imagine this story from the countess’s perspective: After a few of the
marquis’s moves, she sensed the marquis was playing some sort of game,
but the game delighted her. She did not know where he was leading her,
but so much the better. His moves intrigued her, each of them keeping her
waiting for the next one———she even enjoyed her jealousy and confusion, for
sometimes any emotion is be-tier than the boredom of security. Perhaps the
marquis had ulterior motives; most men do. But she was willing to wait and

probably if she had been made to wait long enough, what he was

up to would not have mattered.

The moment the marquis uttered that fatal word “love,” however, all

changed. This was no longer a game with moves, it was an artless show
of passion. His intention was revealed: He was seducing her. This put

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1850 the young Otto von Bismarck, then a thirty—five—yearvold deputy in

the Prussian parliament, was at a turning point in his career. The issues of
the day were the unification of the many states (including Prussia) into
which Germany was then divided, and a war against Austria, the powerful

neighbor to the south that hoped to keep the Germans weak and at odds,
even
threatening to intervene if they tried to unite. Prince William, next in
line to be P:ussia’s king, was in favor of going to war, and the parliament
rallied to the cause, prepared to back any mobilization of troops. The only
ones to
oppose war were the present king, Frederick William IV, and his
ministers, who preferred to appease the powerful Austrians.
Throughout his career, Bismarck had been a loyal, even passionate
supporter of Prussian might and power. He dreamed of German unification, of going to war against Austria and humiliating the country that for so
long had kept Germany divided. A former soldier, he saw warfare as a glorious business.

This, after all, was the man who years later would say, “The great
questions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions, but
by iron and blood.”
Passionate patriot and lover of military glory, Bismarck nevertheless
gave a speech in parliament at the height of the war fever that astonished
all who heard it “Woe unto the statesman,” he said, “who makes war without a reason that will still be valid when the war is over! After the war, you

will all look differently at these questions. Will you then have the courage
to turn to the

peasant contemplating the ashes of his farm, to the man who

has been crippled, to the father who has lost his children?” Not only did

Bismarck go on to talk of the madness of this war, but, strangest of all, he

praised Austria and defended her actions. This went against everything he
had stood for. The consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against
the wa.r——what could this possibly mean? Other deputies were confused,

and several of them changed their votes. Eventually the king and his ministers won out, and war was averted.

A few weeks after Bisma.rck’s infamous speech, the king, grateful that
LAW 3

19

he had spoken for peace, made him a cabinet minister. A few years later he
became the Prussian premier. In this role he eventually led his country and
a.

peace-loving king into a war against Austria, crushing the former empire

and establishing a

German state, with Prussia at its head.

lnterpretation
At the time of his speech in 1850, Bismarck made several calculations.
First, he sensed that the Prussian military, which had not kept pace with
other European armies, was unready for war--that Austria, in fact, might
very well win, a disastrous result for the future. Second, if the war were lost
and Bismarck had supported it, his career would be gravely jeopardized.
The king and his conservative ministers wanted peace; Bismarck wanted

power. The answer was to throw people off the scent by supporting a cause
he cletested, saying things he would laugh at if said by another. A whole

country was fooled. It was because of Bismarck’s speech that the king made
him a minister, at position from which he quickly rose to be prime minister,

attaining the power to strengthen the Prussian military and accomplish
what he had wanted all along: the humiliation of Austria and the unifica»
tion of Germany under Prussia’s leadership.

Bismarck was certainly one of the cleverest statesman who ever lived,

of strategy and deception. No one suspected what he was up to in
this case. Had he announced his real intentions, arguing that it was better
a master

to wait now and fight later, he would not have won the argument, since
most Prussians wanted war at that moment and mistakenly believed that

their army was superior to the Austrians. Had he played up to the king,

asking to be made a minister in exchange for supporting peace, he would
not have succeeded either: The king would have distrusted his ambition
and doubted his sincerity.
By being completely insincere and sending misleading signals, howhe deceived everyone, concealed his purpose, and attained everyhe
wanted. Such is the power of hiding your intentions.
thing
ever,

KEYS TO POWER

Most people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out their opinions at every opportunity, and constantly reveal their plans and intentions.

They do this for several reasons. First, it is easy and natural to always want
to talk about one’s feelings and plans for the future. It takes effort to control
your tongue and monitor what you reveal. Second, many believe that by
being honest and open they are winning people's hearts and showing their
good nature.They are greatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instrument, which bloodies more than it cuts. Your honesty is likely to offend
people; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what
they want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or
think. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so
predictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you,
and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions.
20

LAW 3

If you yearn for power, quickly lay honesty aside, and train yourself in
the art of concealing your intentions. Master the art and you will always

have the upper hand. Basic to an ability to conceal one’s intentions is a

simple tmth about human nature: Our first instinct is to always trust appearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and
hear—-constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else
would exhaust and terrify us. This fact makes it relatively easy to conceal
one’s intentions. Simply dangle an object you seem to desire, a goal you
seem to aim for, in front of
people’s eyes and they will take the appearance
for reality. Once their eyes focus on the decoy, they will fail to notice what
you are really up to. In seduction, set up conflictinghsignals, such as desire
and indiiference, and you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame
their desire to possess you.
A tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to

support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiments.
(Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.) Most people will
believe you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to

play so lightly with something as emotional as one’s opinions and values.
The same applies for any decoyed object of desire: Seem to want something in which you are actually not at all interested and your enemies will
be thrown oil the scent. making all kinds of errors in their calculations.
During the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of Marlborough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key French fort,
because it protected a vital thoroughfare into France. Yet he knew that if be
destroyed it, the French would realize what he wanted-to advance down
that road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned it with
some of his troops, making it
appear as if he wanted it for some purpose of
his own. The French attacked the fort and the duke let them recapture it.
Once they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that the duke had

wanted it for some important reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road

unprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into France,
Use this tactic in the following manner: Hide your intentions not by
closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspicious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals—~just not your
real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly,
was

open, and trusting; you conceal your intentions; and you send your rivals
on timeconsuming wild~goose chases.

Another powerful tool in throwing people oh’ the scent is false sincerity. People easily mjstake sincerity for honesty. Remember-their first in
stinct is to trust appearances, and since they value honesty and want to
believe in the honesty of those around them, they will rarely doubt you or
see through your act. Seeming to believe what you

hard to doubt. It is important, of course, not to go too far in this area. Sin~
cexity is a tricky tool: Appear overpassionate and you raise suspicions. Be
measured and believable or your ruse will seem the put-on that it is.
To make your false sincerity an effective weapon in concealing your

intentions, espouse a belief in honesty and fertlirightness as important social values. Do this as publicly as possible. Emphasize your position on this

subject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt thought-though only one
that is actually meaningless or irrelevant, of course. Napoleon"; minister
Talleyrand was a master at taking people into his confidence by revealing
some apparent secret. This feigned confidence——a decoy—-would then
elicit a real confidence on the other person’s part.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
In 1910, a Mr. Sam Geezil of Chicago sold his warehouse business for close
to $1 million. He settled down to semiretirement and the managing of his

many properties, but deep inside he itched for the old days of deal-making.
One day a young man named Joseph Weil visited his office, wanting to buy

apartment he had up for sale. Geezil explained the terms: The price was
$8,000, but he only required a down payment of $2,000. Weil said he
would sleep on it, but he came back the following day and offered to pay
the full $8,000 in cash, if Geezil could wait a couple of days, until a deal
Weil was working on came through. Even in semiretirement, a clever busian

nessman

like Geezil was curious as to how Weil would be able to come up

with so much cash (roughly $150,000 today) so quickly. Wei] seemed reluctant to say, and

quickly changed the subject, but Geezil was persistent. Fi-

nally, after assurances of confidentiality, Weil told Geezil the following
story.

the secretary to a coterie of multimillionaire financiers. These wealthy gentlemen had purchased a hunting lodge in
was

Michigan ten years ago, at a cheap price. They had not used the lodge for a
few years, so they had decided to sell it and had asked Weil’s uncle to get
whatever he could for it. For reasons——-good reasons—of his own, the uncle
had been nursing a grudge against the millionaires for years; this was his
chance to get back at them. He would sell the property for $35,000 to a setup man (whom it was Weil’s job to find). The financiers were too wealthy to
worry about this low price. The set-up man would then turn around and
sell the property again for its real price, around $155,000. The uncle, Weil,
and the third man would split the profits from this second sale. It was all

legal and for a good cause—the uncle’s just retribution.
Geezil had heard enough: He wanted to be the set-up buyer. Weil was
reluctant to involve him, but Geezil would not back dovmz The idea of a

large profit, plus a little adventure, had him champing at the bit. Weil explained that Geezil would have to put up the $35,000 in cash to bring the
deal off. Geezil, a millionaire, said he could get the money with a snap of
his fingers. Weil finally relented and agreed to arrange a meeting between
the uncle, Geezil, and the financiers, in the town of Galesburg, Illinois.
On the train ride to Galesburg, Geezil met the uncle—a.n impressive

companion, a somewhat paundiy man named George Gross. Weil ex-

plained to Geezil that he himself was a boxing trainer, that Gross was one
of the promising piizefighters he trained, and that he had asked Gross to
come
along to make sure the fighter stayed in shape. For a promising
fighter, Gross was unimpressive looking—he had gray hair and a beer
belly—but Geezil was so excited about the deal that he didn‘t really think
about the man’s flabby appearance.
Once in Galesburg, Weil and his uncle went to fetch the financiers
while Geezil waited in a hotel room with Gross, who promptly put on his
boxing trunks. As Geezil half watched, Gross began to shadowbox. Distracted as he was, Geezil ignored how badly the boxer wheezed after a few
minutes of exercise, although his style seemed real enough. An hour later,
Weil and his uncle reappeared with the financiers, an impressive, intimidat
ing gmup of men, all wearing fancy suits. The meeting went well and the financiers agreed to sell the lodge to Geezil, who had already had the

with any ill will, he offered his own $35,000 cash for part of the bet. Even if
he lost that, he would wire for more money and still make a. profit on the
sale of the lodge. The uncle and nephew thanked him. With their own

$15,000 and Geezil’s $35,000 they would manage to have enough for the
bet. That evening,

as

Geezil watched the two boxers rehearse the fix in

the hotel room, his mind reeled at the killing he was going to make from both
the boxing match and the sale of the lodge.
The fight took place in a gym the next day. Well handled the cash,

which was placed for security in a locked box. Everything was pro»

ceeding as planned in the hotel room. The financiers were looking glum at
how badly their fighter was doing, and Geezil was dreaming about the easy
money he was about to make. Then, suddenly, a wild swing by the linai1cier’s fighter hit Gross hard in the face, knocking him down. When he
hit the canvas, blood spurted from his mouth. He coughed, then lay still.

One of the financiers, a former doctor, checked his pulse; he was dead. The
millionaires panicked: Everyone had to get out before the police arrived-—

they could all be charged with murder.
Terrified, Geezil hightailed it out of the gym and back to Chicago, leavbehind
his $35,000 which he was only too glad to forget, for it seemed

a small
price to pay to avoid being implicated in a crime. He never wanted
to see Weil or any of the others again.
After Geezil scurried out, Gross stood up, under his own steam. The

blood and hot water that he had hidden in his cheek. The whole affair had
been masterminded by Weil, better known as “the Yellow Kid,” one of the

THOMAS Crmsv, 1991

The Yellow Kid had staked out Geezil as the perfect sucker long before he
set up the con. He knew the

boxingmatch scam would be the perfect ruse

separate Geezil from his money quickly and definitively. But he also
knew that if he had begun by trying to interest Geezil in the boxing match,
to

he would have failed miserably. He had to conceal his intentions and
switch attention, create a smoke screen-—-in this case the sale of the lodge.
On the train ride and in the hotel room Geezil’s mind had been com-

pletely occupied with the pending deal, the easy money, the chance to
hobnob with wealthy men. He had failed to notice that Gross was out of
shape and middle-aged at best. Such is the distracting power of a smoke
screen. Engrossed in the business deal, Gee-zil’s attention was easily di—
verted to the boxing match, but only at a point when it was already too late
for him to notice the details that would have given Gross away. The match,

after all, now depended on a bribe rather than on the boxer’s physical condi~
lion. And Geezil was so distracted at the end by the illusion of the boxer’s death

that he completely forgot about his money.

Learn from the Yellow Kid: The familiar, inconspicuous front is the

perfect smoke screen. Approach your mark with an idea that seems ordi~
nary enough—a business deal, financial intrigue. The sucker’s mind is dis
tracted, his suspicions allayed. That is when you gently guide him onto the

second path, the slippery slope down which he slides helplessly into your

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In the mid-1920s, the powerful warlords of Ethiopia were coming to the realization that a young man of the nobility named Haile Selassie, also
known as Ras Tafari, was outcompeting them all and nearing the point

where he could proclaim himself their leader, unifying the country for the
first time in decades. Most of his rivals could not understand how this

wispy,'quiet, mild—mannered man had been able to take control. Yet in

1927, Selassie was able to summon the warlords, one at a time, to come to
Amldis Ababa to declare their loyalty and recognize him as leader.
Some hurried, some hesitated, but only one, Dejazmach Balcha of
Sidamo, dared defy Selassie totally. A blustery man, Balcha was a great
warrior, and he considered the new leader weak and unworthy. He pointedly stayed away from the capital. Finally Selassie, in his gentle but stern
way, commanded Balcha to come. The warlord decided to obey, but in
doing so he would turn the tables on this pretender to the Ethiopian

throne: He would come to Addis Ababa at his own speed, and with an
army of 10,000 men, a. force large enough to defend himself, perhaps even
start a civil war. Stationing this formidable force in a valley three miles
from the capital, he waited, as a king would. Selassie would have to come
to him.

Selassie did indeed send emissaries, asking Balcha to attend an after»
noon

banquet in his honor. But Balcha, no fool, knew history—he knew

that previous kings and lords of Ethiopia had used banquets

as

a

trap.

Once he was there and full of drink, Selassie would have him arrested or
murdered. To signal his understanding of the situation, he agreed to come
to the

banquet, but only if he could bring his personal b0dyguaId—-500 of

his best soldiers, all armed and ready to defend him and themselves. To
Balcha’s

surprise, Selassie answered with the utmost politeness that he

would be honored to play host to such warriors.
On the way to the banquet, Balcha warned his soldiers not to get
drunk and to be on their guard. When they arrived at the palace, Selassie
was his

charming best. He deferred to Balcha, treated him as if he desperately needed his approval and cooperation. But Balcha refused to be
charmed, and he warned Selassie that if he did not return to his camp by
nightfall, his army had orders to attack the capital. Selassie reacted as if
hurt by his mistrust. Over the meal, when it came time for the traditional
singing of songs in honor of Ethiopia’s leaders, he made a. point of allowing
only songs honoring the warlord of Sidarno. It seemed to Balcha that Se»
lassie was scared, intimidated by this great warrior who could not be outwittecl. Sensing the change, Balcha believed that he would be the one to
call the shots in the days to come.
At the end of the afternoon, Balcha and his soldiers began their march
back to camp amidst cheers and gun salutes. Looking back to the capital
over his shoulder, he
planned his strategy—-how his own soldiers would
march through the capital in triumph within weeks, and Selassie would be
put in his place, his place being either prison or death. When Balcha came
in sight of his camp, however, he saw that something was terribly wrong.
Where before there had been colorful tents stretching as far as the eye
could see, now there was nothing, only smoke from doused fires. What
devil’s magic was this?
A witness told Balcha what had happened. During the banquet, a large

army, commanded by an ally of Selassie’s, had stolen up on Balcha’s encampment by a side route he had not seen. This army had not come to

light, however: Knowing that Balcha would/have heard a noisy battle and
26

LAW 3

hurried back with his 600-man bodyguard, Selassie had .armed his own

troops with baskets of gold and cash. They had surrounded Balcha’s army
and proceeded to purchase every last one of their weapons. Those who re»
fused were easily intimidated. Within a few hours, Balcha’s entire force had

been disarmed and scattered in all directions.
Realizing his danger, Balcha decided to march south with his 600 soldiers to regroup, but the same army that had disarmed his soldiers blocked
his way. The other way out was to march on the capital, but Selassie had set
a

large army to defend it. Like a chess player, he had predicted Balcha’s

moves, and had checkmatecl him. For the first time in his life, Balcha sur-

rendered. To repent his sins of pride and ambition, he agreed to enter a
‘

monastery.

Interpretation
Throughout Selassie’s long reign, no one could quite figure him out.
Ethiopians like their leaders fierce, but Selassie, who wore the front of a
gentle, peaceloving man, lasted longer than any of them. Never angry or
impatient, he lured his victims with sweet smiles, lulling them with charm
and obsequiousness before he attacked. In the case of Balcha, Selassie
played on the man’s wariness, his suspicion that the banquet was a trap—
which in fact it was, but not the one he expected. Selassie’s way of allaying
Balcha’s fears—letting him bring his bodyguard to the banquet, giving him

top billing there, making him feel in contro1—-created a thick smoke screen,

concealing the real action three miles away.
Remember: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive.
Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their
View in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating

blow. A helpful or apparently honest gesture, or one that implies the other

persorfs supen‘ority——these are perfect diversionary devices.
Properly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power. It enabled the gentle Selassie to totally destroy his enemy, without firing a single
bullet.

KEYS TO POWER

If you believe that deceivers are colorful folk who mislead with elaborate
lies and tall tales, you are greatly mistaken. The best deceivers utilize a
bland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention to themselves. They
know that extravagant words and gestures immediately raise suspicion. In-

stead, they envelop their marlc in the familiar, the banal, the ha.rmless. In
Yellow Kid Weil’s dealings with Sam Geezil, the familiar was a business
deal. In the Ethiopian case, it was Selassie’s misleading obsequiousness—

exactly what'Balcha. would have expected from a weaker warlord.
LAW 3

27

Once you have lulled your suckers’ attention with the familiar, they
will not notice the deception being perpetrated behind their backs. This

derives from a simple truth: people can only focus on one thing at a time. It
is really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and harmless per~
son

they are dealing with is simultaneously setting up something else. The

grayer and more uniform the smoke in your smoke screen, the better it
conceals your intentions. In the decoy and red herring devices discussed in
Part I, you actively distract people; in the smoke screen, you lull your vic-

tims, drawing them into your web. Because it is so hypnotic, this is often
the best way of concealing your intentions.
The simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind a bland,

unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection.
This is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to perfect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelfs face. Baron

james Rothschild made a lifelong practice of disguising his real thoughts be
hind bland smiles and nondescript looks. Stendhal wrote of Talleyrand,
“Never was a face less of a barometer.” Henry Kissinger would bore his op—
ponents around the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice,
his blank look, his endless recitations of details; then, as their eyes glazed
over, he would

suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught off»

guard, they would be easily intimidated. As one poker manual explains it,
“While playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead he
practices a bland behavior that minimizes readable patterns, frustrates and
confuses opponents, permits greater concentration,”
An adaptable concept, the smoke screen can be practiced on a num-

ber of levels, all playing on the psychological principles of distraction and
misdirection. One of the most effective smoke screens is the noble gesture.

People want to believe apparently noble gestures are genuine, for the belief
is pleasant. They rarely notice how deceptive these gestures can be.

The art dealerjoseph Duveen was once confronted with a terrible problem. The millionaires who had paid so dearly for Duveen’s paintings were

running out of wall space, and with inheritance taxes getting ever higher, it
seemed unlikely that they would keep buying. The solution was the National

Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which Duveen helped create in 1937 by
getting Andrew Mellon to donate his collection to it. The National Gallery
was the
perfect front for Duveen. In one gesture, his clients avoided taxes,
cleared wall space for new purchases, and reduced the number of paintings
on the market, maintaining the upward pressure on their prices. All this
while the donors created the appearance of being public benefactors.
Another effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment of a se
ries of actions that seduce the victim into believing you will continue in the
same way. The

pattern plays on the psychology of anticipation: Our behav~

ior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think.

In 1878 the American robber baronjay Gould created a company that
began to threaten the monopoly of the telegraph company Western Union.
The directors of Western Union decided to buy Gould’s company up-

LAW 3

they had to spend a hefty sum, but they figured they had managed to rid
themselves of an irritating competitor. A few months later, though, Gould
was it at again,
complaining he had been treated unfairly. He started up a
second company to compete with Western Union and its new acquisition.
The same thing happened again: Western Union bought him out to shut
him up. Soon the pattern began for the third time, but now Gould went for
the jugular: He suddenly staged a bloody takeover struggle and managed
to gain complete control of Western Union. He had established a pattern
that had tricked the company’s directors into thinking his goal was to be
bought out at a handsome rate. Once they paid him off, they relaxed and
failed to notice that he was actually playing for higher stakes. The pattern is
powerful in that it deceives the other person into expecting the opposite of
what you are really doing.
Anotlier psychological weakness on which to construct a smoke screen
is the tendency to mistake appearances for reality-——the feeling that if someone seems to
belong to your group, their belonging must be real. This habit
makes the seamless blend a very effective front. The trick is simple: You sim«

ply blend in with those around you. The better you blend, the less suspicious you become. During the Cold War of the 1950s and ’60s, as is now
notorious, a slew of British civil servants passed secrets to the Soviets. They
went undetected for years because they were apparently decent chaps, had
gone to all the right schools, and lit the oldvboy network perfectly. Blend~
ing in is the perfect smoke screen for spying. The better you do it, the better you can conceal your intentions.

Remember: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors,
to put on the mask of the inconspicuous. Do not

despair at having to wear

such a bland rnask~—it is often your unreadability that draws people to you

and makes you appear a person of power.

REVERSAL
No smoke screen, red herring, false sincerity, or any other diversionary device will succeed in concealing your intentions if you already have an es-

tablished

reputation for deception. And as you get older and achieve
increasingly difficult to disguise your cunning.
Everyone knows you practice deception; persist in playing naive and you
run the risk of seeming the rankest
hypocrite, which will severely limit
success, it often becomes

your room to maneuver. In such cases it is better to own up, to appear the
honest rogue, or, better, the repentant rogue. Not only will you be admired
for your frankness, but, most wonderful and strange of all, you will be able
to continue your stratagems.

As P. T. Barnum, the nineteenth-century king of humbuggery, grew

older, he learned to embrace his reputation as a grand deceiver. At one

point he organized a buffalo hunt in New jersey, complete with Indians
and a few imported buffalo. He publicized the hunt as genuine, but it came
off as so completely fake that the crowd, instead of getting angry and asking for their money back, was greatly amused. They knew Barnum pulled
t:ricks all the time; that was the secret of his success, and they loved him for
it. Learning a lesson from this affair, Barnum stopped concealing all of his

devices, even revealing his deceptions in a tell—all autobiography. As

Kierkegaard wrote, “The world wants to be deceived.”
Finally, although it is wiser to divert attention from your purposes by
presenting a bland, familiar exterior, there are times when the colorful,
conspicuous gesture is the right diversionary tactic. The great charlatan
mountebanks of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe used humor
and entertainment to deceive their audiences. Dazzled by a great show, the
public would not notice the charlatans’ real intentions. Thus the star charlatan himself would appear in town in a night-black coach drawn by black
horses. Clowns, tightrope walkers, and star entertainers would accompany
him, pulling people in to his demonstrations of elixirs and quack potions.
The charlatan made entertainment seem like the business of the day; the
business of the day was actually the sale of the elixirs and quack potions.
Spectacle and entertainment, clearly, are excellent devices to conceal
your intentions, but they cannot be used indefinitely. The public grows
tired and suspicious, and eventually catches on to the trick. And indeed the
charlatans had to move quickly from town to town, before word spread
that the potions were useless and the entertainment a trick. Powerful people with bland exteriors, on the other hand—the Talleyrands, the Rothschilds, the Selassies—can practice their deceptions in the same place
throughout their lifetimes. Their act never wears thin, and rarely causes
suspicion. The colorful smoke screen should be used cautiously, then, and
only when the occasion is right.

And then Coriolanus spoke again, mostly addressing the wealthy citizens who had accompanied him. His words were

In the court of Louis XIV, nobles and ministers would spend days and

nights debating issues of state. They would confer, argue, make and break
alliances, and argue again, until finally the critical moment arrived: Two of
them would be chosen to represent the different sides to Louis himself,

who would decide what should be done. After these persons were chosen,

everyone would argue some more: How should the issues he phrased?

Finally, after all this was settled, the fateful moment would finally at»

Louis would listen in silence, a most enigmatic look on his face. Fi-

The ministers and courtiers would never hear another word on this

subject from the king——they would simply see the result, weeks later, when
he would come to a decision and act. He would never bother to consult
them on the matter again.

lnterpretation
Louis XIV was a man of very few words. His most famous remark is
"

‘fiat, c’est moi” (“I am the state”); nothing could be more pithy yet more
eloquent. His infamous “I shall see” was one of several extremely short
phrases that he would apply to all manner of requests.
Louis was not always this way; as a young man he was known for talkat
ing length, delighting in his own eloquence. His later taciturnity was selfimposed, an act, a mask he used to keep everybody below him off-balance.
No one knew exactly where he stood, or could predict his reactions. No
one could
try to deceive him by saying what they thought he wanted to

formation he would later use against them to great effect.
In the end, Louis’s silence kept those around him terrified and under

his thumb. It was one of the foundations of his power. As Saint—Simon

wrote, “No one knew as well as he how to sell his words, his smile, even his
glances. Everything in him was valuable because he created differences,
and his majesty was enhanced by the sparseness of his words.”
It is evm more damaging for a minister to sayfoalish things than to do them.
(Ianlimzl de Rm, 1613 1679

KEYS T0 POWER
Power is in many ways a game of appearances, and when you say less than
necessary, you inevitably appear greater and more powerful than you are.
Your silence will make other people uncomfortable. Humans are machines
of interpretation and explanation; they have to know what you are think»

ing. When you carefully control what you reveal, they cannot pierce your
intentions or your meaning.
34

LAW 4

Your short answers and silences will put them on the defensive, and

they will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of comments
that will reveal valuable information about them and their weaknesses.

They will leave a meeting with you feeling as if they had been robbed, and
they will go home and ponder your every word. This extra attention to
your brief comments will only add to your power.
Saying less than necessary is not for kings and statesmen only. In most
areas of life, the less
you say, the more profound and mysterious you appear. As a young man, the artist Andy Warhol had the revelation that it was
generally impossible to get people to do what you wanted them to do by
talking to them. They would turn against you, subvert your wishes, disobey
you out of sheer perversity. He once told a friend, “I learned that you actu~
ally have more power when you shut up.”
in his later life Warhol employed this strategy with great success. His

interviews were exercises in oracular speech: He would say something

vague and ambiguous, and the interviewer would twist in circles trying to
figure it out, imagining there was something profound behind his often

meaningless phrases. Warhol rarely talked about his work; he let others do
the interpreting. He claimed to have learned this technique from that master of enigma Marcel Duchamp, another twentieth-century artist who realized early on that the less he said about his work, the more people talked
about it. And the more they talked, the more valuable his work became.

By saying less than necessary you create the appearance of meaning
and power. Also, the less you say, the less risk you run of saying something
foolish, even dangerous. In 1825 a new czar, Nicholas 1, ascended the
throne of Russia. A rebellion immediately broke out, led by liberals de-

manding that the country modemize~—-that its industries and civil structures catch up with the rest of Europe. Brutally crushing this rebellion (the
Decembrist Uprising), Nicholas I sentenced one of its leaders, Kondraty
Ryleyev, to death. On the day of the execution Ryleyev stood on the
lows, the noose around his neck. The trapdoor opened~——~but as Ryleyev
dangled, the rope broke, dashing him to the ground. At the time, events
like this were considered signs of providence or heavenly will, and a man
saved from execution this way was usually pardoned. As Ryleyev got to his
feet, bruised and dirtied but believing his neck had been saved, he called
out to the crowd, “You see, in Russia they don’t know how to do anything
properly, not even how to make rope!”
A messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with news of the
failed hanging. Vexed by this disappointing turnabout, Nicholas 1 nevertheless began to sign the pardon. But then: “Did Ryleyev say anything after
this miracle?” the czar asked the messenger. “Sire,” the messenger replied,
“he said that in Russia they don’t even know how to make rope.”
“In that case,” said the Czar, “let us prove the contrary,” and he tore
the
up
pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hanged again. This time the
rope did not break.
Learn the lesson: Once the words are out, you cannot take them back.

Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The moLAW 4

the price you pay.

REVERSAL
There are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse suspicion
and even insecurity, especially in your superiors; a vague or ambiguous

During China’s War of the Three Kingdoms (A.D. 207—265), the great general Chuko Liang, leading the forces of the Sim Kingdom, dispatched his
vast army to a distant camp while he rested in a small town with a handful

of soldiers. Suddenly sentinels hurried in with the alarming news that an

enemy force of over 150,000 troops under Sima Yi was approaching. With
only a hundred men to defend him, Chuko Liang’s situation was hopeless.
The enemy would finally capture this renowned leader.

Interpretation
Chuko Liang was commonly known as the “Sleeping Dragon.” His exploits in the War of the Three Kingdoms were legendary. Once a man
claiming to be a disaffected enemy lieutenant came to his camp, offering
help and information. Liang instantly recognized the situation as a setup;
this man was a false deserter, and should be beheaded. At the last minute,

though, as the ax was about to fall, Liang stopped the execution and offered to spare the man’s life if he agreed to become a double agent. Grate
ful and terrified, the man agreed, and began supplying false information to
the enemy. Liang won battle after battle.
On another occasion Liang stole a military seal and created false documents
dispatching his enemy’s troops to distant locations. Once the troops
had dispersed, he was able to capture three cities, so that he controlled an
entire corridor of the enemy’s kingdom. He also once tricked the enemy
into believing one of its best generals was a traitor, forcing the man to escape and join forces with Liang. The Sleeping Dragon carefully cultivated
his reputation of being the cleverest man in China, one who always had a
trick up his sleeve. As powerful as any weapon, this reputation struck fear
into his enemy.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In 1841 the young P. T. Barnum, trying to establish his reputation as Amer-

ica's premier showman, decided to purchase the American Museum in
Manhattan and turn it into a collection of curiosities that would secure his
fame. The problem was that he had no money. The museum’s asking price
was

to

$15,000, but Barnum was able to put together a proposal that appealed

principal partner changed

his mind, and the museum and its collection were sold to the directors of
Peale’s Museum. Barnum was infuriated, but the partner explained that

business was business——the museum had been sold to Pea1e’s because
Peale’s had a reputation and Barnum had none.
Barnum immediately decided that if he had no reputation to bank on,

his only recourse was to min the reputation of Peale’s. Accordingly he
launched a letter-writing campaign in the newspapers, calling the owners a
bunch of “broken-down bank directors” who had no idea how to run a museum or entertain people. He warned the public against buying Peale’s
stock, since the business’s purchase of another museum would invariably
spread its resources thin. The campaign was effective, the stock plummeted, and with no more confidence in Pea.le’s track record and reputa-

tion, the owners of the American Museum reneged on their deal and sold
the whole thing to Barnum.
It took years for Pea.le’s to recover, and they never forgot what Barnum

had done. Mr. Peale himself decided to attack Barnum by building a

reputation for “highbrow entertainment,” promoting his museum’s pro
grams as more scientific than those of his vulgar competitor. Mesmerism

Barnum organized a rival mesmeric performance in which he himself

without her noticing. But as he sharpened the knife, the little girl’s eyes

popped open and she ran away, to the audience’s delight. He repeated this
and other parodies for several weeks. Soon no one could take Peale’s show
seriously, and attendance went way down. Within a few weeks, the show
closed. Over the next few years Bamum established a reputation for audac-

ity and consummate showtnanship that lasted his whole life. Pea1e’s reputation, on the other hand, never recovered.

Interpretation
Bamum used two different tactics to ruin Peale’s reputation. The first was

simple: He sowed doubts about the museum’s stability and solvency.
Doubt is a powerful weapon: Once you let it out of the bag with insidious
rumors, your opponents are in a horrible dilemma. On the one hand they
can
deny the rumors, even prove that you have slandered them. But a
layer of suspicion will remain: Why are they defending themselves so desperately? Maybe the rumor has some truth to it? If, on the other hand, they
take the high road and ignore you, the doubts, unrefuted, will be even
stronger. If done correctly, the sowing of rumors can so infuriate and unsettle your rivals that in defending themselves they will make numerous mistakes. This is the perfect weapon for those who have no reputation of their
own to

work from.

Once Bamum did have a reputation of his own, he used the second,

gentler tactic, the fake hypnotism demonstration: He ridiculed his rivals’
reputation. This too was extremely successful. Once you have a solid base
of respect, ridiculing your opponent both puts him on the defensive and
draws more attention to you, enhancing your own reputation. Outright
slander and insult are too strong at this point; they are ugly, and may hurt
you more than help you. But gentle barbs and mockery suggest that you
have a strong enough sense of your own worth to enjoy a good laugh at
your rival’s expense. A humorous front can make you out as a harmless entertainer while poking holes in the reputation of your rival.
It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation.
Friedrirh /Vietzsrhrc, 18-44—I 900

KEYS TO POWER

The people around us, even our closest friends, will always to some extent
remain mysterious and unfathomable. Their characters have secret recesses

that they never reveal. The unknowableness of other people could prove

disturbing if we thought about it long enough, since it would make it impossible for us really to judge other people. So we prefer to ignore this fact,
and to judge people on their appearances, on what is most visible to our

eyes—-clothes, gestures, words, actions. In the social realm, appearances are
the barometer of almost all of our judgments, and you must never be nusled into believing otherwise. One false slip, one awkward or sudden change
in your appearance, can prove disastrous.
4!)

LAW 5

This is the reason for the supreme importance of making and maintaining a reputation that is of your own creation.
That reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of appearances, distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what you are
really like, and giving you a degree of control over how the world judges
you—a powerful position to be in. Reputation has a power like magic:
With one stroke of its wand, it can double your strength. It can also send

people scurrying away from you. Whether the exact same deeds appear
brilliant or dreadful can depend entirely on the reputation of the deer.
In the ancient Chinese court of the Wei kingdom there was a man
named Mi Tzu-hsia who had a reputation for supreme civility and graciousness.

He became the mler’s favorite. It was a law in Wei that “whoever

rides secretly in the ruler’s coach shall have his feet cut off,” but when Mi

Tzu-hsia’s mother fell ill, he used the royal coach to visit her, pretending

that the ruler had given him permission. When the ruler found out, he said,
“How dutiful is Mi Tzu-hsia! For his mother’s sake he even forgot that he
was

committing a crime making him liable to lose his feet!”
Another time the two of them took a stroll in an orchard. Mi Tzu-hsia

began eating a peach that he could not finish, and he gave the ruler the
other half to eat. The ruler remarked, “You love me so much that you would
even

forget your own saliva taste and let me eat the rest of the peach!”

Later, however, envious fellow courtiers, spreading word that Mi Tzuhsia was actually devious and arrogant, succeeded in damaging his reputation; the ruler came to see his actions in a new light “This fellow once rode
in my coach under pretense of my order,” he told the courtiers angrily,

“and another time he gave me a half-eaten peach.” For the same actions
that had charmed the ruler when he was the favorite, Mi Tzu-hsia now had
to suffer the

penalties. The fate of his feet depended solely on the strength

of his reputation.
In the beginning, you must work to establish a reputation for one out-

standing quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This quality
sets you apart and gets other people to talk about you. You then make your
reputation known to as many people as possible (subtly, though; take care
to build slowly, and with a firm foundation), and watch as it spreads like
wildfire.
A solid

reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your
without
strengths
your having to spend much energy. It can also create an
around you that will instill respect, even fear. In the fighting in the
North African desert during World War II, the German general Erwin
aura

Rommel had a reputation for cunning and for deceptive maneuvering that
struck terror into everyone who faced him. Even when his forces were de-

pleted, and when British tanks outnumbered his by five to one, entire cities
would be evacuated at the news of his approach.
As they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it inspires
respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive on the scene,
or utter a

single word.

Your success seems destined by your past triumphs. Much of the sucLAW 5

41

cess

of Henry Kissinger‘s shuttle diplomacy rested on his reputation for

ironing out differences; no one wanted to be seen as so unreasonable that
Kissinger could not sway him. A peace treaty seemed a fait accompli as
soon as

Kissinger’s name became involved in the negotiations.

Make your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality. This

single quality—-efiiciency, say, or seductiveness-—becomes a kind of calling
card that announces your presence and places others under a spell. A reputation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception.
Casanova used his reputation as a great seducer to pave the way for his future conquests; women who had heard of his powers became

immensely

curious, and wanted to discover for themselves what had made him so ro-

mantically successful.
Perhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are prevented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to associate
with someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name
to whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for example, to erase a reputation for dishonesty by yourself; but a paragon of honesty can help. ‘Nixon
P. T. Barnum wanted to clean up a reputation for promoting vulgar entertainment, he brought the singer jenny Lind over from Europe. She had a
stellar, high—class reputation, and the American tour Bamum sponsored for
her greatly enhanced his own image. Similarly the great robber barons of
nineteentlrcentury America were long unable to rid themselves of a reputation for cruelty and mean-spiritedness. Only when they began collecting
art, so that the names of Morgan and Frick became permanently associated
with those of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften their unpleasant image.
Reputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. Especially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it strictly, anticipating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or
defensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies—that reveals inse-

curity, not confidence in your reputation. Take the high road instead, and
appear desperate in your self—defense. On the other hand, an attack
on another man’s
reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you
have less power than he does. He has much more to lose in such a battle,
and your own thus~far-small reputation gives him a. small target when he
tries to return your fire. Bamum used such campaigns to geat effect in his
early career. But this tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem
to engage in petty vengeance. If you do not break your enemy’s reputation
never

cleverly, you will inadvertently ruin your own.
Thomas Edison, considered the inventor who harnessed electricity,
believed that a workable system would have to be based on direct current

(DC). When the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla appeared to have suc-

ceeded in creating a system based on alternating current (AC), Edison was
furious. He determined to ruin Tesla’s reputation, by making the public be-

lieve that the AC system was inherently unsafe, and Tesla irresponsible in

promoting it.
To this end he captured all kinds of household pets and electrocuted
42

LAW 5

them to death with an AC current. When this wasn’t enough, in 1890 he got
New York State prison authorities to organize the world’s first execution by

electrocution, using an AC current. But Edison’s electrocution experiments
had all been with small creatures; the charge was too weak, and the man

only half killed. In perhaps the country’s cruelest state-authorized exe
cufion, the procedure had to be repeated. It was an awful spectacle.
Although, in the long run, it is Edison’s name that has survived, at the

was

time his

campaign damaged his own reputation more than Tesla’s. He

backed off. The lesson is simple-—never go too far in attacks like these, for
that will draw more attention to your own vengefulness than to the person
you are slandering. When your own reputation is solid, use subtler tactics,
such as satire and ridicule, to weaken your opponent while making you out

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAVV
P. T. Barnum, America’s premier nineteenth-century showman, started his
career as an

assistant to the owner of a circus, Aaron Turner. In 1836 the

circus stopped in Annapolis, Maryland, for a series of performances. On
the morning of opening day, Barnum took a stroll through town, wearing a

black suit. People started to follow him. Someone in the gathering

crowd shouted out that he was the Reverend Ephraim K. Avery, infamous
as a man

acquitted of the charge of murder but still believed guilty by most

Americans. The angry mob tore off Bamum’s suit and was ready to lynch
him. After desperate appeals, Barnum finally convinced them to follow
him to the circus, where he could verify his identity.
Once there, old Turner confirmed that this was all a practical joke-—he

we need to ensure success is

talking about the joke, and the circus was packed that night and every night
it stayed in Annapolis. Barnum had learned a lesson he would never forget.
Bamum‘s first big venture of his own was the American Museum——a
collection of curiosities, located in New York. One day a beggar approached Bamum in the street. Instead of giving him money, Bamum decided to employ him. Taking him back to the museum, he gave the man

and to answer no questions. Once back at the museum, he was to

enter, walk around inside, then leave through the back door and make the

On the man’s first walk through the streets, several hundred people
watched his mysterious movements. By his fourth circuit, onlookers
swarmed around him, debating what he was doing. Every time he entered
the museum he was followed by people who bought tickets to keep watch»

In 1842, Barnum purchased the carcass of what was purported to be a

mermaid. This creature resembled a monkey with the body of a fish, but

the head and body were perfectly joined—it was truly a wonder. After
some research Barnum discovered that the creature had been

expertly put
together injapan, where the hoax had caused quite a stir.
He nevertheless planted articles in newspapers around the country
claiming the capture of a mermaid in the Fiji Islands. He also sent the pa—
pers woodcut prints of paintings showing mermaids. By the time he showed
the specimen in his museum, a national debate had been sparked over the
existence of these mythical creatures. A few months before Batnum’s cam~
paign, no one had cared or even known about mermaids; now everyone
was

talking about them as if they were real. Crowds flocked in record num»

bers to see the Fiji Mermaid, and to hear debates on the subject.
A few years later, Barnum toured Europe with General Tom Thumb. a

five-year—old dwarf from Connecticut whom Bamum claimed was an
elevenvyear-old English boy, and whom he had trained to do many remarkable acts. During this tour Bamum’s name attracted such attention
that Queen Victoria, that paragon of sobriety, requested a private audience
with him and his talented dwarf at Buckingham Palace. The English press
may have ridiculed Bamum, but Victoria was royally entertained by him,
and respected him ever after.
Interpretation
Barnum understood the fundamental truth about

attracting attention:

Once people’s eyes are on you, you have a special legitimacy. For Barnum,
‘

creating interest meant creating a crowd; as he later wrote, “Every crowd
has a silver lining.” And crowds tend to act in conjunction. If one person

stops to see your beggarman laying bricks in the street, more will do the
same.
They will gather like dust bunnies. Then, given a gentle push, they
will enter your museum or watch your show. To create a crowd you have to
do something different and odd. Any kind of curiosity will serve the pur-

pose, for crowds are magnetically attracted by the unusual and inexplicable. And once you have their attention, never let it go. If it veers toward
other people, it does so at your expense. Barnum would ruthlessly suck at~
tention from his competitors, knowing what a valuable commodity it is.

At the beginning of your rise to the top, then, spend all your energy on

attracting attention. Most important: The quality of the attention is irrele
vant. No matter how

KEYS TO POWER

Burning more brightly than those around you is a skill that no one is born
with. You have to learn to attract attention, “as surely as the lodestone at~
tracts iron.” At the start of

your career, you must attach your name and rep-

utation to a quality, an image, that sets you apart from other people. This

image can be something like a characteristic style of dress, or a personality
quirk that amuses people and gets talked about. Once the image is estalr
lished, you have an appearance, a place in the sky for your star.
It is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar appearance of
yours should not be controversial, that to be attacked is somehow bad.
Nothing could be further from the truth. To avoid being a flash in the pan,
and having your notoriety eclipsed by another, you must not discriminate
between different types of attention; in the end, every kind will work in
your favor. Barnum, we have seen, welcomed personal attacks and felt
no need

to defend himself. He deliberately courted the image of being a

humbug.

The court of Louis XIV contained many talented writers, artists, great

beauties, and men and women of impeccable virtue, but no one was more
talked about than the singular Due de Lauzun. The duke was short, almost
dwarfish, and he was prone to the most insolent kinds of behavior-—he

slept with the king’s mistress, and openly insulted not only other courtiers
but the king himself. Louis, however, was so beguiled by the duke’s eccen~
tricities that he could not beat his absences from the court. It was simple:

and draw attention to you. Court controversy, even scandal. It is better to
be attacked, even slandered, than ignored. All professions are ruled by this

law, and all professionals must have a bit of the showman about them.
The great scientist Thomas Edison knew that to raise money he had to
remain in the public eye at any cost. Almost as important as the inventions

themselves was how he presented them to the public and courted attention.
Edison would design w'sual1y dazzling experiments to display his dis~
coveries with electricity. He would talk of future inventions that seemed

fantastic

at

the

time-—robots, and machines that could photograph

thought—-and that he had no intention of wasting his energy on, but that
made the public talk about him. He did everything he could to make sure
that he received more attention than his great rival Nikola Tesla, who may

actually have been more brilliant than he was but whose name was far less
known. In 1915, it was rumored that Edison and Tesla would be joint recipients of that year’s Nobel Prize in physics. The prize was eventually given to
a

pair of English physicists; only later was it discovered that the prize com-

mittee had actually approached Edison, but he had turned them down, re-v

fusing to share the prize with Tesla. By that time his fame was more secure
than Tesla’s, and he thought it better to refuse the honor than to allow his
rival the attention that would have come even from sharing the prize.
If you find yourself in a lowly position that offers little opportunity for
you to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack the most visible, most
famous, most powerful person you can find. When Pietro Aretino, a young
Roman servant boy of the early sixteenth century, wanted to get attention

in the public eye immediately. A slanderous attack on a person in a position of power would have a similar effect. Remember, however, to use such
tactics sparingly after you have the public’s attention, when the act can
wear thin.

Once in the limelight you must constantly renew it by adapting and

varying your method of courting attention. If you don’t, the public will
grow tired, will take you for granted, and will move on to a newer star. The
game requires constant vigilance and creativity. Pablo Picasso never al

PART II: CREATE AN AIR OF MYSTERY

In a world gmwing increasingly banal aindpfamiliai; what seems enigmatic instantly draws attention. Never make it too clear what you are

doing or about to do. Do not show all your canis, /in air of mystery heightens your
presence; it also creates anticipation--everyone will be watching
you to see what happens next. Use mystery to beguile, seduce, even frighten.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW

Beginning in 1905, rumors started to spread throughout Paris of a young
Oriental girl who danced in a private home, wrapped in veils that she gradually discarded. A local journalist who had seen her dancing reported that
“a woman from the Far East had come to Europe laden with perfume and
jewels, to introduce some of the richness of the Oriental colour and iife into
the satiated society of European cities.” Soon everyone knew the dam:er’s
name:

Mata Han‘.

Early that year, in the winter, small and select audiences would gather
in

a

salon filled with Indian statues and other relics while an orchestra

played music inspired by Hindu and Javanese melodies. After keeping the
audience waiting and wondering, Mata Hari would suddenly appear, in a
startling costume: a white cotton brassiere covered with India.n~type jewels;
jeweled bands at the waist supporting a sarong that revealed as much as it
concealed; bracelets up the arms. Then Mata Hari would dance, in a style
no one in France had seen before, her whole body swaying as if she were in
a trance.

She told her excited and curious audience that her dances told

stories from Indian mythology and javanese folktales. Soon the cream of

Paris, and ambassadors from far—off lands, were competing for invitations
to the salon, where it was rumored that Mata. Hari was actually performing
sacred dances in the nude.
The public wanted to know more about her. She told journalists that
she was actually Dutch in origin, but had grown up on the island of java.
She would also talk about time spent in India, how she had learned sacred
Hindu dances there, and how Indian women “can shoot straight, ride

horseback, and are capable of doing logarithms and talk philosophy.” By
the summer of 1905, although few Parisians had actually seen Mata Hari

dance, her name was on everyone’s lips.
As Mata Hari gave more interviews, the story of her origins kept
changing: She had grown up in India, her grandmother was the daughter
of ajavanese princess, she had lived on the island of Sumatra where she
had spent her time “horsebaxzk riding, gun in hand, and risking her life.”
No one knew

certain about her, but journalists did not mind these

changes in her biography. They compared her to an Indian goddess, a
creature from the pages of Baudelaire—whatever their

imagination wanted

to see in this mysterious woman from the East.

In August of 1905, Mata Hari performed for the first time in public.

LAW 6

Crowds thronging to see her on opening night caused a riot. She had now
become

a cult
figure, spawning many imitations. One reviewer wrote,
“Mata Hari personifies all the poetry of India, its mysticism, its voluptuous-

ness, its hypnotizing charm.” Another noted, “If India possesses such unex-

pected treasures, then all Frenchmen will emigrate to the shores of the
Ganges.”
Soon the fame of Mata Hari and her sacred Indian dances spread beyond Paris. She was invited to Berlin, Vienna, Milan. Over the next few
years she performed throughout Europe, mixed with the highest social circles, and earned an income that gave her an independence rarely enjoyed
by a woman of the period. Then, near the end of World War I, she was arrested in France, tried, convicted, and finally executed as a German spy.
Only during the trial did the truth come out: Mata Hari was not from java
or India, had not
grown up in the Orient, did not have a drop of Eastern
blood in her body. Her real name was Margaretha Zelle, and she came
from the stolid northern province of Friesland, Holland.
Interpretation
When Margaretha Zelle arrived in Paris, in 1904, she had half a franc in
her pocket. She was one of the thousands of beautiful young girls who
flocked to Paris every year, taking work as artists’ models, nightclub
dancers, or vaudeville performers at the Folies Bergére. After a few years
they would inevitably be replaced by younger girls, and would often end
up on the streets, turning to prostitution, or else returning to the town they
came

from, older and chastened.

Zelle had higher ambitions. She had no dance experience and had

performed in the theater, but as a young girl she had traveled with
her family and had witnessed local dances in Java and Sumatra. Zelle
never

clearly understood that what was important in her act was not the dance itself, or even her face or figure, but her ability to create an air of mystery
about herself. The mystery she created lay not just in her dancing, or her
costumes, or the stories she would tell, or her endless lies about her origins;
it lay in an atmosphere enveloping everything she did. There was nothing
you could say for sure about her——she was always changing, always surprising her audience with new costumes, new dances, new stories. This air
of mystery left the public always wanting to know more, always wondering
about her next move. Mata Hari was no more beautiful than many of the
other young girls who came to Paris, and she was not a particularly good
dancer. What separated her from the mass, what attracted and held the

public’s attention and made her famous and wealthy, was her mystery.
People are enthralled by mystery; because it invites constant interpretation, they never tire of it. The mysterious cannot be grasped. And what
cannot be seized and consumed creates power.

KEYS TO POWER
In the past, the world was filled with the terrifying and unknowable—

diseases, disasters, capricious despots, the mystery of death itself. What we
could not understand we reimagined as myths and spirits. Over the centuries, though, we have managed, through science and reason, to illuminate the darkness; what was mysterious and

and comfortable. Yet this light has

a

forbidding has grown familiar

price: in a world that is ever more

banal, that has had its mystery and myth squeezed out of it, we secretly

enigmas, people or things that cannot be instantly interpreted,
seized, and consumed.
That is the power of the mysterious: It invites layers of interpretation,
excites our imagination, seduces us into believing that it conceals somecrave

thing marvelous. The world has become so familiar and its inhabitants so
predictable that what wraps itself in mystery will almost always draw the
limelight to it and make us watch it.
Do not imagine that to create an air of mystery you have to be grand
and awe~inspirlng. Mystery that is woven into your day-to-day demeanor,
and is subtle, has that much more power to fascinate and attract attention.
Remember: Most people are upfront, can be read like an open book, take

little care to control their words or image, and are hopelessly predictable.

By simply holding back, keeping silent, occasionally uttering arnbiguous
phrases, deliberately appearing inconsistent, and acting odd in tlie subtlest
of ways, you will emanate an aura of mystery. The people around you will
then magnify that aura by constantly dying to interpret you.
Both artists and con artists understand the vital link between being
mysterious and attracting interest. Count Victor Lustig, the aristocrat of
swindlers, played the game to perfection. He was always doing things that
different, or seemed to make no sense. He would show up at the best
hotels in a limo driven by ajapanese chauffeur; no one had ever seen a

Japanese chauffeur before, so this seemed exotic and strange. Lustig would
dress in the most expensive clothing, but always with something—a medal,
flower, an arrnband—out of place, at least in conventional terms. This

his Japanese chauffeur—telegrams he would tear up with utter noncha-

lance. (In fact they were fakes, completely blank.) He would sit alone in the

dining room, reading a large and impressive-looking book, smiling at people yet remaining aloof. Vlfithin a few days, of course, the entire hotel
would be abuzz with interest in this strange man.
All this attention allowed Lustig to lure suckers in with ease. They

would beg for his confidence and his company. Everyone wanted to be
seen

with this mysterious aristocrat. And in the presence of this distracting

enigma, they wouldn’t even notice that they were being robbed blind.
An air of mystery can make the mediocre appear intelligent and profound. It made Mata Hari, a woman of average appearance and intelligence, seem like a goddess, and her dancing divinely inspired. An air of

52

LAW 6

mystery about an artist makes his or her artwork immediately more intriguing, a trick Marcel Duchamp played to great effect. It is all very easy to

clo—-say little about your work, tease and titillate with alluring, even contra~
dictory comments, then stand back and let others try to make sense of it all.
Mysterious people put others in a kind of inferior position—-that of tryto
ing figure them out. To degrees that they can control, they also elicit the
fear surrounding anything uncertain or unknown. All great leaders know
that an aura of mystery draws attention to them and creates an intimidating
presence. Mao Tse-rung, for example, cleverly cultivated an enigmatic
image; he had no worries about seeming inconsistent or contradicting him~
self-—fl1e very contradictoriness of his actions and words meant that he a.l~
ways had the upper hand. No one, not even his own wife, ever felt they
understood him, and he therefore seemed larger than life. This also meant
that the public paid constant attention to him, ever anxious to witness his
next move.

If your social position prevents you from completely wrapping your
actions in mystery, you must at least learn to make yourself less obvious.

Every now and then, act in a way that does not mesh with other people’s
perception of you. This way you keep those around you on the defensive,
eliciting the kind of attention that makes you powerful. Done right, the ore
ation of enigma. can also draw the kind of attention that strikes terror into
your enemy.

During the Second Punic War (219402 13.0.), the great Carthaginian
general Hannibal was wreaking havoc in his march on Rome. Hannibal
was known for his cleverness and
duplicity.
Under his leadership Carthage’s army, though smaller than those of
the Romans, had constantly outmaneuvered them. On one occasion,
though, Hann1‘bal’s scouts made a horrible blunder, leading his troops into
a
marshy terrain with the sea at their back. The Roman army blocked the
mountain passes that led inland, and its general, Fabius, was ecstatic-at
last he had Hannibal trapped. Posting his best sentries on the passes, he
worked on a plan to destroy Hannibal’s forces. But in the middle of the
night, the sentries looked down to see a mysterious sight: A huge procession of lights was heading up the mountain. Thousands and thousands of
lights. If this was Hannibal’s army, it had suddenly grown a hundredfold.
The sentries argued heatedly about what this could mean: Reinforcements from the sea? Troops that had been hidden in the area? Ghosts? No
explanation made sense.
As they watched, fires broke out all over the mountain, and a horrible
noise drified up to them from below, like the blowing of a million horns.
Demons, they thought. The sentries, the bravest and most sensible in the
Roman army, fled their posts in a panic.
By the next day, Hannibal had escaped from the marshland. What was
his trick? Had he really conjured up demons? Actually what he had done
was order bundles of

twigs to be fastened to the horns of the thousands of
troops as beasts of burden. The twigs were then

oxen that traveled with his

lit, giving the impression of the torches of a vast army heading up the
mountain. When the flames burned down to the oxen’s skin, they stampeded in all directions, bellowing like mad and setting fires all over the
mountainside. The key to this device’s success was not the torches, the
fires, or the noises in themselves, however, but the fact that Hannibal had
created a puzzle that captivated the sentries’ attention and gradually terrified them. From the mountaintop there was no way to explain this bizarre

sight. If the sentries could have explained it they would have stayed at their
posts.
If you find yourself trapped, cornered, and on the defensive in some

situation, try a simple experiment: Do something that cannot be easily explained or interpreted. Choose a simple action, but carry it out in a way
that unsettles your opponent, a way with many possible interpretations,

making your intentions obscure. Don’t just be unpredictable (although this
tactic too can be successful—see Law 17); like Hannibal, create a scene that
cannot be read. There will seem to be no method to your madness, no

rhyme or reason, no single explanation. If you do this right, you will inspire fear and trembling and the sentries will abandon their posts. Call it
the “feigned madness of Hamlet” tactic, for Hamlet uses it to great effect in
Shakespeare‘s play, frightening his stepfather Claudius through the mys-

tery of his behavior. The mysterious makes your forces seem larger, your
power more terrifying.

R EV F. RSAL
In the beginning of your rise to the top, you must attract attention at all
cost, but as you rise higher you must constantly adapt. Never wear the pub-

lic out with the same tactic. An air of mystery works wonders for those who
need to develop an aura of power and get themselves noticed, but it must
seem measured and under control.

Mata Hari went too far with her fabri-

cations; although the accusation that she was a spy was false, at the time it
was a reasonable
presumption because all her lies made her seem suspicious and nefarious. Do not let your air of mystery be slowly transformed
into a reputation for deceit. The mystery you create must seem a game,

playful and unthreatening. Recognize when it goes too far, and pull back.
There are times when the need for attention must be deferred, and
when scandal and notoriety are the last things you want to create. The attention you attract must never offend or challenge the reputation of those

above you—not, at any rate, if they are secure. You will seem not only pal-

try but desperate by comparison. There is an art to knowing when to draw
notice and when to withdraw.

Lola Montez was one of the great practitioners of the art of attracting
attention. She managed to rise from a middle—class Irish background to

being the lover of Franz Liszt and then the mistress and political adviser of
King Ludwig of Bavaria. In her later years, though, she lost her sense of
proportion.
In London in 1850 there was to be a performance of Shakespeare’s
Macbeth featuring the greatest actor of the time, Charles john Kean. Everyone of
even

consequence in English society was to be there; it was rumored that
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were to make a public appearance.

The custom of the period demanded that everyone be seated before the

queen anived. So the audience got there a little early, and when the queen
entered her royal box, they observed the convention of standing up and

applauding her. The royal couple waited, then bowed. Everyone sat down
and the lights were dimmed. Then, suddenly, all eyes turned to a box opposite Queen Victoria’s: A woman appeared from the shadows, taking her
seat later than the queen. It was Lola Montez. She wore a diamond tiara on

her dark hair and a long fur coat over her shoulders. People whispered in
amazement as the ermine cloak was

dropped to reveal a low-necked gown

of crimson velvet. By turning their heads, the audience could see that the

royal couple deliberately avoided looking at Lola’s box. They followed
Victoria’s example, and for the rest of the evening Lola Montez was ig-

nored. After that evening no one in fashionable society dared to be seen
with her. All her magnetic powers were reversed. People would flee her

sight. Her future in England was finished.
Never appear overly greedy for attention, then, for it signals insecurity,
and insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are times when it
is not in your interest to be the center of attention. When in the presence of

king or queen, for instance, or the equivalent thereof, bow and retreat to
the shadows; never compete.

TRANSGRESSION AND OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1883 a young Serbian scientist named Nikola Tesla was working for the

European division of the Continental Edison Company. He was a brilliant
inventor, and Charles Batchelor, a plant manager and a personal friend of
Thomas Edison, persuaded him he should seek his fortune in America, giving him a letter of introduction to Edison himself. So began a life of woe
and tribulation that lasted until Tesla’s death.
When Tesla met Edison in New York, the famous inventor hired him
on the

spot. Tesla worked eighteen-hour days, finding ways to improve the

primitive Edison dynarnos. Finally he offered to redesign them completely.
To Edison this seemed a monumental task that could last years without

paying off, but he told Tesla, “’I'here’s fifty thousand dollars in it for you-—xf
you can do it.” Tesla labored day and night on the project and after only a
year he produced a greatly improved version of the dynamo, complete
with automatic controls. He went to Edison to break the good news and receive his $50,000. Edison was pleased with the improvement, for which he

and his company would take credit, but when it came to the issue of the

money he told the young Serb, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American
lmmori,” and offered a small raise instead.
Tesla’s obsession was to create an alternating-current system (AC) of

electricity. Edison believed in the direct—current system (DC), and not only
refused to support Tesla’s research but later did all he could to sabotage
him. Tesla turned to the great Pittsburgh magnate George Westinghouse,
who had started his own electricity company. Westinghouse completely
funded Tesla’: research and offered him a generous royalty agreement on
future profits. The AC system Tesla developed is still the standard today-—
but after patents were filed in his name, other scientists came forward to
take credit for the invention, claiming that they had laid the groundwork

In 1917, during his later impoverished years, Tesla was told he was to
receive the Edison Medal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

He turned the medal down. “You propose,” he said, “to honor me with a

medal which I could pin upon my coat and strut for a vain hour before the
members of your Institute. You would decorate my body and continue to
let starve, for failure to supply recognition, my mind and its creative prod

Interpretation
Many harbor the illusion that science, dealing with facts as it does, is be
yond the petty rivalries that trouble the rest of the world. Nikola Tesla was
one of those. He believed science had nothing to do with politics, and
claimed not to care for fame and riches. As he grew older, though, this ruined his scientific work. Not associated with any particular discovery, he
could attract no investors to his many ideas. While he pondered great inventions for the future, others stole the patents he had already developed
and got the glory for themselves.
He wanted to do everything on his own, but merely exhausted and impoverished himselfin the process.
Edison was Tesla’s polar opposite. He wasn’t actually much of a scien~
tific thinker or inventor; he once said that he had no need to be a mathematician because he could

always hire one. That was Fdisoifs main
method. He was really a businessman and publicist, spotting the trends and
the opportunities that were out there, then hiring the best in the field to do
the work for him. If he had to he would steal from his competitors. Yet his
name is much

better known than Tesla’s, and is associated with more in-

ventions.

you try to do it all on your own, you run yourself ragged, waste energy, and

KEYS TO POWER

The world of power has flue dynamics of the jungle: There are those who
live by hunting and killing, and there are also vast numbers of creatures

(hyenas, vultures) who live oil" the hunting of others. These latter, less
imaginative types are often incapable of doing the work that is essential for
the creation of power. They understand early on, though, that if they wait
long enough, they can always find another animal to do the work for them.
Do not be naive: At this very moment, while you are slaving away on some
project, there are vultures circling above trying to figure out a way to survive and even thrive off your creativity. It is useless to complain about this,
or to wear

yourself ragged with bitterness, as Tesla did. Better to protect

yourself and join the game. Once you have established a power base, become a vulture
yourself, and save yourself a lot of time and energy.
Of the two poles of this game, one can be illustrated by the example of
the explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa. Balboa had an obsessionw-the discovery of El Dorado, a legendary city of vast riches.
Early in the sixteenth century, after countless hardships and brushes
with death, he found evidence of a great and wealthy empire to the south
of Mexico, in present—day Peru. By conquering this empire, the Incan, and
seizing is gold, he would make himself the next Cortes. The problem was
that even as he made this discovery, word of it spread among hundreds of
other conquistadors. He did not understand that half the game was keeping
it quiet, and carefiilly watching those around him. A few years after he dis-

covered the location of the Incan empire, a soldier in his own army, Francisco Pizarro, helped to get him beheaded for treason. Pizarro went on to

take what Balboa had spent so many years trying to find.

The other pole is that of the artist Peter Paul Rubens, who, late in his
career, found himself

studio
large

specializing in robes, another in backgrounds, and so on. He created a vast
production line in which a large number of canvases would be worked on
at the

same

time. When an important client visited the studio, Rubens

would shoo his hired painters out for the day. While the client watched

from a balcony, Rubens would work at an incredible pace, with unbelievable energy. The client would leave in awe of this prodigious man, who
could paint so many masterpieces in so short a time.
This is the essence of the Law: Loam to get others to do the work for

you while you take the credit, and you appear to be of godlike strength and
power. If you think it important to do all the work yourself, you will never

get far, and you will suffer the fate of the Balboas and Teslas of the world.
Find people with the skills and creativity you lack. Either hire them, while
putting your own name on top of theirs, or find a way to take their work
and make it your own. Their creativity thus becomes yours, and you seem
a

genius to the world.

There is another application of this law that does not require the parasitic use of your contemporaries’ labor: Use the past, a vast storehouse of

LAW 7

knowledge and wisdom. Isaac Newton called this “standing on the shoulders of giants.” He meant that in making his discoveries he had built on the
achievements of others. A great part of his aura of genius, he knew, was attributable to his shrewd ability to make the most of the insights of ancient,
medieval, and Renaissance scientists. Shakespeare borrowed plots, characterizations, and even dialogue from Plutarch, among other writers, for he
knew that nobody surpassed Plutarch in the writing of subtle psychology
and witty quotes. How many later writers have in their turn borrowed

from-~plagz'anlzed——Shakespeare?
We all know how few of today’s politicians write their own speeches.
Their own words would not win them a single vote; their eloquence and

wit, whatever there is of it, they owe to a speech writer. Other people
do the work, they take the credit. The upside of this is that it is a. kind
of power that is available to everyone. Learn to use the knowledge of the

past and you will look like a genius, even when you are really just a clever
borrower,
Writers who have delved into human nature, ancient masters of strat-

egy, historians of human stupidity and folly, kings and queens who have
leamed the hard way how to handle the burdens of power—-their knowl-

edge is gathering dust, waiting for you to come and stand on their shoulders. Their wit can be your wit, their skill can be your skill, and they will
never come around to tell

people how unoriginal you really are. You can
endless
mistakes, wasting time and energy trying
slog through life, making

to do things from your own experience. Or you can use the armies of the

past. As Bismarck once said, “Fools say that they learn by experience. I

prefer to profit by others’ experience.”

There are times when taking the credit for work that others have done is
not the wise course: If your power is not

firmly enough established, you
will seem to be pushing people out of the limelight. To be a. brilliant exploiter of talent your position must be unshakable, or you will be accused
of deception.
Be sure you know when letting other people share the credit serves
your purpose. It is especially important to not be greedy when you have a
master above you. President Richard Nixon’s historic visit to the People’s
Republic of China was originally his idea, but it might never have come off
but for the deft diploma/cy of Henry Kissinger. Nor would it have been as
successful without Kissinger’s skills. Stilh when the time came to take
credit, Kissinger adroitly let Nixon take the lion’s share. Knowing that the
truth would come out later, he was careful not to jeopardize his standing in
the short term by hogging the limelight. Kissinger played the game ex~
partly: He took credit for the work of those below him while graciously
giving credit for his own labors to those above. That is the way to play
the game.

OBSERVANCl:‘ OF THE LAW
At the Congress of Vienna in 1814, the major powers of Europe gathered to
carve up the remains of

Napoleon’s fallen Empire. The city was full of gai-

ety and the balls were the most splendid in memory. Hovering over the

proceedings, however, was the shadow of Napoleon himself. Instead of
being executed or exiled far away, he had been sent to the island of Elba,
not far from the coast of Italy.
Even imprisoned on an island, a man as bold and creative as
Napoleon Bonaparte made everyone nervous. The Austrians plotted to kill
him on Elba, but decided it was too risky. Alexander I, Rnssia’s tempera»
mental czar, heightened the anxiety by throwing a {it during the congress
when a part of Poland was denied him: “Beware, I shall loose the monster!" he threatened. Everyone knew he meant Napoleon. Of all the states
men

gathered in Vienna, only Talleyrand, Napoleon’s former foreign

minister, seemed calm and unconcerned. It was as if he knew something
the others did not.
Meanwhile, on the island of Elba, Napoleon's life was a mockery of his

previous glory. As Elba’s “king,” he had been allowed to form a court-—
there was a cook, a wardrobe mistress, an official pianist, and a. handful of
courtiers. All this was designed to humiliate Napoleon, and it seemed to
work.
That winter, however, there occurred a. series of events so strange and
dramatic they might have been scripted in a play. Elba was surrounded by
British ships, their cannons covering all possible exit points. Yet somehow,
in broad daylight on 26 February 1815, a ship with nine hundred men on
board picked up Napoleon and put to sea The English gave chase but the
ship got away. This almost impossible escape astonished the public

throughout Europe, and terrified the statesmen at the Congress of Vienna.
Although it would have been safer to leave Europe, Napoleon not only
chose to return to France, he raised the odds by marching on Paris with a
tiny army, in hopes of recapturing the throne. His strategy worked——people
of all classes threw themselves at his feet. An army under Marshal Ney sped
from Paris to arrest him, but when the soldiers saw their beloved former
leader, they changed sides. Napoleon was declared emperor again. Volunteers swelled the ranks of his new army. Delirium swept the country. In Paris,

crowds went wild. The king who had replaced Napoleon fled the country.
For the next hundred days, Napoleon ruled France. Soon, however, the
giddiness subsided. France was bankrupt, its resources nearly exhausted,

and there was little Napoleon could do about this. At the Battle of Waterloo,
injune of that year, he was finally defeated for good. This time his enemies
had learned their lesson: They exiled him to the barren island of Saint I-Ie~

lena, off the west coast of Africa. There he had no more hope of escape.

Interpretation
Only years later did the facts of Napoleon's dramatic escape from Elba
come to

light. Before he decided to attempt this bold move, visitors to his

court had told him that he was more popular in France than ever, and that
LAW 8

63

the country would embrace him again. One of these visitors was Austria’s
General Keller, who convinced Napoleon that if he escaped, the European

powers, England included, would welcome him back into power. Napoleon
was
tipped off that the English would let him go, and indeed his escape occurred in the middle of the afternoon, in full view of English spyglasses.

What Napoleon did not know was that there was a man behind it all,

pulling the strings, and that this man was his former minister, Talleyrand.
And Talleyrand was doing all this not to bring back the glory days but to
crush Napoleon once and for all. Considering the emperor’s ambition unsettling to Europe’s stability, he had turned against him long ago. When
Napoleon was exiled to Elba, Talleyrand had protested. Napoleon should
be sent farther away, he argued, or Europe would never have peace. But
no one

Listened.

Instead of pushing his opinion, Talleyrand bided his time. Working

quietly, he eventually won over Castlereagh and Metternich, the foreign
ministers of England and Austria.
Together these men baited Napoleon into escaping. Even Koller’s visit,
to whisper the promise of glory in the exile’s ear, was part of the plan. Like
a master
cardplayer, Talleyrand figured everything out in advance. He
knew Napoleon would fall into the trap he had set He also foresaw that
Napoleon would lead the country into a war, which, given France’s wea.k~
ened condition, could only last a few months. One diplomat in Vienna,
who understood that Talleyrand was behind it all, said, “He has set the
house ablaze in order to save it from the plague.”

KEYS TO POWER
How many times has this scenario played itself out in history: An aggres~
sive leader initiates a series of bold moves that begin by bringing him

much power. Slowly, however, his power reaches a peak, and soon every-

thing turns against him. His numerous enemies band together; trying to
maintain his power, he exhausts himself going in this direction and that,

and inevitably he collapses. The reason for this pattern is that the aggressive person is rarely in full control. He cannot see more than a couple of
moves

ahead, cannot see the consequences of this bold move or that one.

Because he is constantly being forced to react to the moves of his ever-

growing host of enemies, and to the unforeseen consequences of his own
rash actions, his aggressive energy is turned against him.
In the realm of power, you must ask yourself, what is the point of chashere
and there, trying to solve problems and defeat my enemies, if I
ing
never feel in control?
Why am I always having to react to events instead of
them?
The
answer is
directing
simple: Your idea of power is wrong. You
M

LAW 8

have mistaken aggressive action for effective action. And most often the
most effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be frustrated

by the trips you lay for them, playing for long-term power rather than
quick victory.
Remember: The essence of power is the ability to keep the initiative,
keep your opponent and those
around you on the defensive. When you make other people come to you,
you suddenly become the one controlling the situation. And the one who
to get others to react to your moves, to

has control has power. Two things must happen to place you in this position: You yourself must learn to master your emotions, and never to be in-

fluenced by anger; meanwhile, however, you must play on people’s natural

tendency to react angrily when pushed and baited. In the long run, the
ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any
tool of aggression.

Study how Talleyrand, the master of the art, performed this delicate
trick. First, he overcame the urge to try to convince his fellow statesmen
that they needed to banish Napoleon far away. It is only natural to want to

persuade people by pleading your case, imposing your will with words. But
this often turns against you. Few of Talleyrand’s contemporaries believed
Napoleon was still a threat, so that if he had spent a lot of energy trying to
convince them, he would only have made himself look foolish. Instead, he
held his tongue and his emotions in check. Most important of all, he laid

Napoleon a sweet and irresistible trap. He knew the man’s weakness, his
impetuosity, his need for glory and the love of the masses, and he played
all this to perfection. When Napoleon went for the bait, there was no danger that he might succeed and turn the tables on Talleyrand, who better
than anyone knew France’s depleted state. And even had Napoleon been
able to overcome these difficulties, the likelihood of his success would have
been greater were he able to choose his time and place of action. By setting

the proper trap, Talleyrand took the time and place into his own hands.
All of us have only so much energy, and there is a moment when our

energies are at their peak. ‘When you make the other person come to you,
he wears himself out, wasting his energy on the trip. In the year 1905, Russia ancl japan were at war. The Japanese had only recently begun to mod
emize their warships, so that the Russians had a stronger navy, but by
spreading false information the Japanese marshal Togo Heihachiro baited
the Russians into leaving their docks in the Baltic Sea, making them believe

they could wipe out the Japanese fleet in one swift attack. The Russian fleet
could not reachjapan by the quickest route——through the Strait of Gibral—
tar and then the Suez

Canal into the Indian Ocean"-because these were

You have your bearings, while they see nothing familiar and are subtly

Manipulation is a dangerous game. Once someone suspects he is
being manipulated, it becomes harder and harder to control him. But
when you make your opponent come to you, you create the illusion that he
is controlling the situation. He does not feel the strings that pull hirmjust as

Napoleon imagined that he himself was the master of his daring escape and

Everything depends on the sweetness of your bait. If your trap is at»
tractive enough, the turbulence of your enemies’ emotions and desires will
blind them to reality. The greedier they become, the more they can he led
around.

The great nineteenth-century robber baron Daniel Drew was a master
playing the stock market. When he wanted a particular stock to be
bought or sold, driving prices up or down, he rarely resorted to the direct
approach. One of his tricks was to hurry through an exclusive club near
Wall Street, obviously on his way to the stock exchange, and to pull out his
customary red bandanna to wipe his perspiring brow. A slip of paper
would fall from this bandanna that he would pretend not to notice. The
club’s members were always trying to foresee Drew’s moves, and they
would pounce on the paper, which invariably seemed to contain an inside
up on a stock. Word would spread, and members would buy or sell the
stock in droves, playing perfectly into Drew’s hands.
If you can get other people to dig their own graves, why sweat yourself? Pickpockets work this to perfection. The key to picking a pocket is
knowing which pocket contains the wallet. Experienced pickpockets often
ply their trade in train stations and other places where there is a. clearly
marked sign reading BEWARE OF PICKPOCKE’l‘S. Passersby seeing the sign invariably feel for their wallet to make sure it is still there. For the watching
pickpockets, this is like shooting fish in a barrel. Pickpockets have even
been known to place their own BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS signs to ensure
at

their success.
V/Vhen you are making people come to you, it is sometimes better to let
them know you are forcing their hand. You give up deception for overt ma-

nipulation. The psychological ramifications are profound: The person who
makes others come to him appears powerful, and demands respect.
Filippo Brunelleschi, the great Renaissance artist and architect, was a
great practitioner of the art of making others come to him as a sign of his
power. On one occasion he had been engaged to repair the dome of the
Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral in Florence. The commission was impor66

LAW 8

lam and

prestigious. But when the city officials hired a second man,

Lorenzo Ghibem‘, to work with B1-unelleschi, the great artist brooded in se~
cret. He knew that Ghiberti had gotten the job through his connections,
and that he would do none of the work and get half the credit. At a critical
moment of the construction, then, Brunelleschi suddenly developed a mys-

terious illness. He had to stop work, but pointed out to city officials that

they had hired Ghiberti, who should have been able to continue the work
on his own. Soon it became clear that Ghiberti was useless and the ofiicials
came

begging to Brunelleschi. He ignored them, insisting that Ghiberti

should finish the project, until finally they realized the problem: They fired

Ghiberti.

By some miracle, Bnmelleschi recovered within days. He did not have
to throw a tantrum or make a fool of himself; he simply practiced the art of

“making others come to you.”
If on one occasion you make it a point of dignity that others must
come to you and you

succeed, they will continue to do so even after you

stop trying.

Although it is generally the wiser policy to make others exhaust themselves
chasing you, there are opposite cases where strildng suddenly and aggressively at the enemy so demoralizes him that his energies sink. Instead of
making others come to you, you go to them, force the issue, take the lead.
Fast attack can be an awesome weapon, for it forces the other person to
react without the time to think or plan. With no time to think, people make

judgment, and are thrown on the defensive. This tactic is the ob-

your enemy respond on your terms.
Men like Cesare Borgia and Napoleon used the element of speed to intimidate ancl control. A rapid and unforeseen move is terrifying and de-

moralizing. You must choose your tactics depending on the situation. If
you have time on your side, and know that you and your enemies are at
least at equal strength, then deplete their strength by making them come to

you. If time is against you—-your enemies are weaker, and waiting will only
give them the chance to recover—-give them no such chance. Strike quickly
and they have nowhere to go. As the boxer Joe Louis put it, “He can run,

The soldiers warned the engineer that their master was not a man to
argue with, but he insisted that the smaller mast would be the only one that

would work with a machine that he was constructing to go with it. He drew

diagram after diagram, and went so far as to say that he was the expert and
they had no clue what they were talking about. The soldiers knew their
leader and at last convinced the engineer that it would be better to swallow
his expertise and obey.
After they left, though, the engineer thought about it some more. What

ure? And so he sent the smaller mast, confident that the consul would see

how much more effective it was and reward him justly.

When the smaller mast arrived, Mucianus asked his soldiers for an ex-

planation. They described to him how the engineer had argued endlessly
for the smaller mast, but had finally promised to send the larger one. Mucianus went into a rage. He could not concentrate on the siege, or consider

the importance of breaching the walls before the town received reinforce»
merits. All he could think about was the

impudent engineer, whom he or-

dered to be brought to him immediately.

LAW 51

Interpretation
The engineer, whose name has not been recorded by history, had spent his
life designing masts and pillars, and was respected as the finest engineer in

city that had excelled in the science. He knew that he was right. A smaller
would allow more speed and carry more force. Larger is not necessarily better. Of course the consul would see his logic, and would eventually
understand that science is neutral and reason superior. How could the consul possibly persist in his ignorance if the engineer showed him detailed dia

ram

agrams and explained the theories behind his advice?
The military engineer was the quintessence of the Arguer,

at

type

found everywhere among us. The Arguer does not understand that words

are never

neutral, and that by arguing with a superior he impugns the intel

ligence of one more powerful than he. He also has no awareness of the person he is dealing with. Since each man believes that he is right, and words
will rarely convince him otherwise, the arguer’s reasoning falls on deaf
ears. When cornered, he
only argues more, digging his own grave. Once
he has made the other person feel insecure and inferior in his beliefs, the

eloquence of Socrates could not save the situation.
It is not simply a question of avoiding an argument with those who
stand above you. We all believe we are masters in the realm of opinions
and reasoning. You must be careful, then: Learn to demonstrate the correctness of your ideas indirectly.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW

In 1502, in Florence, Italy, an enormous block of marble stood in the
works department of the church of Santa Maria del Fiore. It had once been

magnificent piece of raw stone, but an unskillful sculptor had mistakenly
bored a hole through it where there should have been a figure’s legs, generally mutilating it. Piero Soderini, Florence’s mayor, had contemplated
trying to save the block by commissioning Leonardo da Vinci to work on
it, or some other master, but had given up, since everyone agreed that the
stone had been ruined. So, despite the money that had been wasted on it, it
gathered dust in the dark halls of the church.
This was where things stood until some Florentine friends of the great
Michelangelo decided to write to the artist, then living in Rome. He alone,
they said, could do something with the marble, which was still magnificent
raw material.
Michelangelo traveled to Florence, examined the stone, and
came to the conclusion that he could in fact carve a fine
figure from it, by

Soderini argued

that this was a waste of time——nobody could salvage such a disasterwbut
he finally agreed to let the artist work on it. Michelangelo decided he
would depict a. young David, sling in hand.
Weeks later, as Michelangelo was putting the final touches on the
statue, Soderini entered the studio. Fancying himself it bit of a connoisseur,
he .-studied the huge work, and told Michelangelo that while he thought it
was magnificent, the nose, he judged, was too big. Michelangelo realized
that Soderini was standing in 2 place right under the giant figure and did
not have the proper perspective. Without a word, he gestured for Soderini
to follow him up the scaffolding. Reaching the nose, he picked up his
as well as a bit of marble dust that
lay on the planks. With Sodetini
just a few feet below him on the scaffolding. Michelangelo started to tap
lightly with the chisel, letting the bits of dust he had gathered in his hand to
fall little by little. He actually did nothing to change the nose, but gave
every appearance of working on it. After a few minutes of this charade he
stood aside: “Look at it now.” “I like it better,” replied Soderini, “you’ve

aesthetic judgment. To offend such a man by arguing would not only gain

Michelangelo nothing, it would put future commissions in jeopardy.
Michelangelo was too clever to argue. His solution was to change
Soden‘m"s perspective (literally bringing him closer to the nose) without
making him realize that this was the cause of his misperception.
Fortunately for posterity, Michelangelo found a way to keep the per
faction of the statue intact while at the same time making Soderini believe
he had improved it. Such is the double power of winning through actions
rather than argument: No one is offended, and your point is proven.

KEYS T0 POWER
In the realm of power you must learn to judge your moves by their long»

effects on other people. The problem in trying to prove a point or
gain a. victory through argument is that in the end you can never be certain
how it affects the people you’re arguing with: They may appear to agree

term

with you politely, but inside they may resent you. Or perhaps something

you said inadvertently even offended thern—-words have that insidious
ability to be interpreted according to the other person’s mood and insecurities. Even the best argument has no solid foundation, for we have all come
to distrust the

slippery nature of words. And days after agreeing with some

one, we ofien revert to our old opinion out of sheer habit.

Understand this: Words are a dime a dozen. Everyone knows that in
the heat of an argument, we will all say anything to support our cause. We
will quote the Bible, refer to unverifiable statistics. Who can be persuaded

by bags of air like that? Action and demonstration are much more powerful and meaningful. They are there, before our eyes, for us to see-——“Yes,
now the statue’s nose does look
just right.” There are no offensive words,
no
of
possibility misinterpretation. No one can argue with a demonstrated
proof. As Baltasar Graciim remarks, “The midi is generally seen, rarely
heard.”
Sir Christopher Wren was England’s version of the Renaissance man.
He had mastered the sciences of mathematics, astronomy, physics, and
physiology. Yet during his extremely long career as England’s most Cele‘

brated architect he was often told by his patrons to make impractical

changes in his designs. Never once did he argue or offend. He had other
ways of proving his point.
In 1688 Wren designed a magnificent town hall for the city of Westminster. The mayor, however. was not satisfied; in fact he was nervous. He

told Wren he was afraid the second {floor was not secure, and that it could
all come crashing down on his office on the first floor. He demanded that
Wren add two stone columns for extra support. Wren, the consummate en-

gineer, knew that these columns would serve no purpose, and that the

mayor’s fears were baseless. But build them he did, and the mayor was
grateful. It was only years later that workmen on a high scaffold saw that
the columns stopped just short of the ceiling.
They were dummies. But both men got what they wanted: The mayor
could relax, and Wren knew posterity would understand that his original

dedgn worked and the columns were unnecessary.

The power of demonstrating your idea is that your opponents do not

A heclder once interrupted Nikita. Khrushchev in the middle of a

speech in which he was denouncing the crimes of Stalin. “You were a colleague of Stalirfs,” the heekler yelled, “why didn’t you stop him then?”
Khrushschev apparently could not see the heckler and barked out, “VVho
said that?” No hand went up. No one moved a muscle. After a few seconds

of tense silence, Khrushchev finally said in a quiet voice, “Now you know

why I didn’t stop him.” Instead of just arguing that anyone facing Stalin
was afraid, knowing that the
slightest sign of rebellion would mean certain
he

them feel the paranoia, the fear of speaking up, the terror of confronting
the leader, in this case Khrushchev. The demonstration was visceral and no
more

argument was necessary.

The most powerful persuasion goes beyond action into symbol. The

power of a symbol——a flag, a mythic story, a monument to some emotional
event--is that everyone understands you without anything being said. In

move.

This technique has saved the hide of many a con artist. Once Count
Victor Lustig, swindle: par excellence, had sold dozens of suckers around
the country a phony box with which he claimed to be able to copy money.

Discovering their mistake, the suckers generally chose not to go the police,
rather than risk the embarrassment of publicity. But one Sherifi Richards,
74

LAW 9

of Rernsen County, Oklahoma, was not the kind of man to accept being
conned out of $10,000, and one morning he tracked Lustig down to a hotel
in Chicago.

Lustig heard a knock on the door. When he opened it he was looking
down the barrel of a gun. “What seems to be the problem?” he calmly
asked. “You son of a bitch,” yelled the sheriff, “I’m going to kill you. You
conned me with that damn box of yours!” Lustig feigned confusion. “You
mean it’s not

working?” he asked. “You know it’s not working,” replied the

sheriff. “But that’s impossible,” said Lustig. “There’s no way it couldn’t be

working. Did you operate it properly?” “I did exactly what you told me to
do,” said the sheriff. “No, you must have done something wrong,” said
Lustig. The argument went in circles. The barrel of the gun was gently lowcred.

Lustig next went to phase two in the argument tactic: He poured out a
whole bunch of technical gobbledygook about the borfis operation, com-

pletely beguiling the sheriff, who now appeared less sure of himself and argued less forcefully. “Look,” said Lusfig, “I’ll give you your money back
right now. I’ll also give you written instruclions on how to work the machine and I’ll come out to Oklahoma to make sure it’s working properly.
There’s no way you can lose on that.” The sheriff reluctantly agreed. To
satisfy him totally, Lustig took out a hundred one-hundred—dollar bills and
gave them to him, telling him to relax and have a fun weekend in Chicago.
Calmer and a little confused, the sheriff finally left Over the next few days
Lustig checked the paper every morning. He finally found what he was
looking for: A short arficle reporting Sheriff Richa.rcls’s arrest, trial, and
conviction for passing counterfeit notes. Lustig had won the argument; the
sheriff never bothered him again.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Born in Limerick, Ireland, in 1813, Marie Gilbert came to Paris in the
18405 to make her fortune as a dancer and performer. Taking the name
Lola Montez (her mother was of distant Spanish descent), she claimed to
be a flamenco dancer from Spain. By 1845 her career was languishing, and

Only one man could salvage Lola’s dancing career: Alexandre Dujaxier, owner of the newspaper with the largest circulation in France, and
also the newspaper’s drama critic. She decided to woo and conquer him.
Investigating his habits, she discovered that he went riding every morning.
An excellent horsewoman herself, she rode out one morning and “acciden~

tally” ran into him. Soon they were riding together every day. A few weeks
later Lola moved into his apartment.
For a while the two were happy together. With Duja.rier’s help, Lola

began to revive her dancing career. Despite the risk to his social standing,
Dujarier told friends he would marry her in the spring. (Lola had never
told him that she had eloped at age nineteen with an Englishman, and was
still legally married.) Although Dujarier was deeply in love, his life started
to slide downhill.

His fortunes in business changed and influential friends began to avoid

him. One night Dujarier was invited to a party, attended by some of the
wealthiest young men in Paris. Lola wanted to go too but he would not
allow it. They had their first quarrel, and Dujarier attended the party by

himself. There, hopelessly drunk, be insulted an influential drama critic,

In 1846 Lola. Montez found herself in Munich, where she decided to

discovered, was through his aide-de-camp, Count Otto Von Rechberg, a
man with a fondness for
pretty girls. One day when the count was breakat
an outdoor cafe, Lola rode
fastirig

thrown from the saddle, and landed at Rechberg’s feet. The count rushed

help her and was enchanted. He promised to introduce her to Ludwig.
Rechberg arranged an audience with the king for Lola, but when she
arrived in the anteroom, she could hear the king saying he was too busy to
meet a favorseeking stranger. Lola pushed aside the sentries and entered

to

his room anyway. In the process, the front of her dress somehow got torn

(perhaps by her, perhaps by one of the sentries), and to the astonishment of
all, most especially the king, her bare breasts were brazenly exposed. Lola
was

granted her audience with Ludwig. Fifty—five hours later she made her

debut on the Bavarian stage; the reviews were terrible, but that did not stop

Ludwig was, in his own words, “bewitched” by Lola. He started
public with her on his arm, and then he bought and furnished

though he had been known as a miser, and was not given to flights of

fancy, he started to shower Lola with
his favored mistress, she catapulted to fame and fortune overnight.
Lola began to lose her sense of proportion. One day when she was out

riding, an elderly man rode ahead of her, a bit too slowly for her liking.
Unable to pass him, she began to slash him with her riding crop. On another occasion she took her dog, unleashed, out for a stroll. The dog at»
tacked a passerby, but instead of helping the men get the dog away, she
whipped him with the leash. Incidents like this infuriated the stolid citizens
of Bavaria, but Ludwig stood by Lola and even had her naturalized as a
Bavarian citizen. The kings entourage tried to wake him to the dangers of
the affair, but those who criticized Lola were summarily fired.

While Bavarians who had loved their

king now outwardly disre—
spected him, Lola was made a countess, had a new palace built for herself,
and began to dabble in politics, advising Ludwig on policy. She was the
most powerful force in the kingdom. Her influence in the king’s cabinet
continued to grow, and she treated the other ministers with disdain. As a

result, riots broke out throughout the realm. A once peaceful land was vir~

rually in the grip of civil war, and students everywhere were chanting,
“Raus mit Lola!”

By February of 1848, Ludwig was finally unable to withstand the presWith great sadness he ordered Lola. to leave Bavaria immediately.
She left, but not until she was paid off. For the next five weeks the Bevan‘ans’ wrath was turned against their formerly beloved king. In March of that

Lola Montez moved to England. More than anything she needed re-

spectability, and despite being married (she still had not arranged a divorce
from the Englishman she had wed years before), she set her sights on
George Trafford Heald, a promising young army olficer who was the son of
an influential hamster. Although he was ten
years younger than Lola, and
could have chosen a wife among the prettiest and wealthiest young girls of
English society, Heald fell under her spell. They were married in 1849.
Soon arrested on the charge of bigamy, she skipped bail, and she and
Heald made their way to Spain. They quarreled horribly and on one occasion Lola slashed him with a. knife. Finally, she drove him away. Returning
to England, he found he had lost his position in the army. Ostracized from
English society, he moved to Portugal, where he lived in poverty. After a
few months his short life ended in a boating accident.

As is often the case with infection, the problems would only arise over
time. Lola’s inherent instability would begin to get under her lovers’ skin.

They would find themselves drawn into her problems, but their emotional
attachment to her would make them want to help her. This was the crucial
point of the clisease--for Lola Montez could not be helped. Her problems
were too deep. Once the lover identified with them, he was lost. He would
find himself embroiled in quarrels. The infection would spread to his family and friends, or, in the case of Ludwig, to an entire nation. The only so
lution would be to cut her off, or suller an eventual collapse.
The infecting-character type is not restricted to women; it has nothing
to do with gender. It stems from an inward instability that radiates outward,
drawing disaster upon itself. There is almost a desire to destroy and unset

KEYS TO POWER

Those misfortunates among us who have been brought down by circumstances

beyond their control deserve all the help and sympathy we can

give them. But there are others who are not born to misfortune or unhappi~
ness, but who draw it upon themselves by their destructive actions and un-

settling effect on others. It would be a great thing if we could raise them up,

change their patterns, but more often than not it is their patterns that end
up getting inside and changing us. The reason is siinple-humans are extremely susceptible to the moods, emotions, and even the ways of thinking
of those with whom they spend their time.
The incurably unhappy and unstable have a particularly strong infect»

mg power because their characters and emotions are so intense. They often
present themselves as victims, making it difficult, at first, to see their miseries as self-inflicted. Before you realize the real nature of their problems

you have been infected by them.
Understand this: In the game of power, the people you associate with

associating with infeclors is that you will waste valu
able time and energy trying to free yourself. Through a kind of guilt by asare critical. The risk of

sociation, you will also suffer in the eyes of others. Never underestimate the

dangers of infection.
There are many kinds of infector to be aware of, but one of the most
insidious is the sufferer from chronic dissatisfaction. Cassius, the Roman

conspirator against Julius Caesar, had the discontent that comes from deep
envy. He simply could not endure the presence of anyone of greater talent.

Probably because Caesar sensed the man’s interminable soumess, he
passed him up for the position of first praetorship, and gave the position to
Brutus instead. Cassius brooded and broorled, his hatred for Caesar be

coming pathological. Brutus himself, a. devoted republican, disliked Caesar’s dictatorship; had he had the patience to wait, he would have become
the first man in Rome after Ca.esar‘s death, and could have undone the evil
that the leader had wrought. But Cassius infected him with his own rancor,

bending his ear daily with tales of Caesafs evil. He finally won Brutus over
to the conspiracy. It was the beginning of a great tragedy. How many misfortunes could have been avoided had Brutus learned to fear the power of
infection.

There is only one solution to infection: quarantine. But by the time
you recognize the problem it is often too late. A Lola Montez oveiwhelms
you with her forceful personality. Cassius intrigues you with his confiding
nature and the

depth of his feelings. How can you protect yourself against
such insidious viruses? The answer lies in judging people on the effects
they have on the world and not on the reasons they give for their probImage: A Virus. Unseen, it

tor; learn to see the discontent in their eye. Most important of all, do not
take pity. Do not enmesh yourself in trying to help. The infector will re
main unchanged, but you will be unhinged.

The other side of infection is equally valid, and perhaps more readily
understood: There are people who attract happiness to themselves by their

good cheer, natural buoyancy, and intelligence. They are a source of plea:
sure, and you must associate with them to share in the prospeiity they draw
upon themselves.
50

LAW 10

This applies to more than good cheer and success: All positive quali~
ties can

infect us. Talley:-and had many strange and intimidating traits, but

most agreed that he surpassed all Frenchmen in gmciousness, aristocratic

charm, and wit. Indeed he came from one of the oldest noble families in
the country, and despite his belief in democracy and the French Republic,
he retained his courtly manners. His contemporary Napoleon was in many
ways the opposite~—~a peasant from Corsica, tacitum and ungracious, even
violent.
There was no one Napoleon admired more than Talleyrand. He envied his minister’s way with people, his wit and his

ability to charm

women, and as best he could, he kept Talleyrand around him, hoping to

soak up the culture he lacked. There is no doubt that Napoleon changed as
his rule continued. Many of the rough edges were smoothed by his constant association with Talleyrand.

.

Use the positive side of this emotional osmosis to advantage. If, for ex-

ample, you are miserly by nature, you will never go beyond a certain limit;
only generous souls attain greatness. Associate with the generous, then,
and they will infect you, opening up everything that is tight and restricted
in you. If you are gloomy, gravitate to the cheerful. If you are prone to iso
lation, force yourselfto befriend the gregarious. Never associate with those
who share your defects——~they will reinforce everything that holds you
back. Only create associations with positive aflinities. Make this a rule of
life and you will benefit more than from all the therapy in the world.

Authority: Recognize the fortu~
so
that you may choose
their company, and the 1mfortu—

nate

so
that you may avoid
them. Misfortune is usually the

nate

crime of folly, and among those

who suffer from it there is no

malady more contagious: Never
open your door to the least of
misfortunes, for, if you do, many

others will follow in its train.

.

.

.

Do not die of another’s misery.

{Baltasar Grecian, 1601-1658)

REVERSAL
This law admits of no reversal. Its application is universal. There is nothing
to be gained by associating with those who infect you with their misery;

there is only power and good fortune to be obtained by associating with
the fortunate. Ignore this law at your peril.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW

Sometime in the Middle Ages, a mercenary soldier (a condottiere), whose
name

has not been recorded, saved the town of Siena from a foreign ag~

gressor. How could the good citizens of Siena reward him? No amount of
money or honor could possibly compare in value to the preservation of a

city’s liberty. The citizens thought of making the mercenary the lord of the
city, but even that, they decided, wasn’t recompense enough. At last one of
them stood before the assembly called to debate this matter and said, “Let
us kill him and then
worship him as our patron saint.” And so they did.
The Count of Carmagnola was one of the bravest and most successful
of all the condottieri. In 1442, late in his life, he was in the employ of the city
of Venice, which was in the midst of a long war with Florence. The count
was
suddenly recalled to Venice. A favorite of the people, he was received
there with all kinds of honor and splendor. That evening he was to dine
with the doge himself, in the doge’s palace. On the way into the palace,
however, he noticed that the guard was leading him in a different direction
from usual. Crossing the famous Bridge of Sighs, he suddenly realized
where they were taking him—to the dungeon. He was convicted on a
trurnped~up charge and the next day in the Piazza San Marco, before a
horrified crowd who could not understand how his fate had changed s
drastically, he was beheaded.

Many of the great tomlottieri of Renaissance Italy suffered the same fate as
the patron saint of Siena and the Count of Carrnagnolaz They won battle
after battle for their employers only to find themselves banished, imprisoned, or executed. The problem was not ingratitude; it was that there were
so
many other candottieri as able and valiant as they were. They were replaceable. Nothing was lost by killing them. Meanwhile, the older among
them had grown powerful themselves, and wanted more and more money
for their services. How much better, then, to do away with them and hire a

younger, cheaper mercenary. That was the fate of the Count of Carmagnola, who had started to act impudently and independently. He had taken
his power for granted without making sure that he was truly indispensable.

Such is the fate (to a less violent degree, one hopes) of those who do
not make others

dependent on them. Sooner or later someone comes along
who can do the job as well as they can-—someone younger, fresher, less expensive, less threatening.
Be the only one who can do what you do, and make the fate of those who
hire you so entwined with yours that they cannot possibly get rid of you.
Otherwise you will someday be forced to cross your own Bridge of Sighs.

liament’s liberals or conservatives, not any particular minister, and cer-

tainly not the people. It was with the king, Frederick William IV. This was
an odd choice to
say the least, for Frederick was at a low point of his power.
A weak, indecisive man, he consistently gave in to the liberals in pa1:lia~
merit; in fact he was spineless, and stood for much that Bismarck disliked,
personally and politically. Yet Bismarck courted Frederick night and day.
When other deputies attacked the king for his many inept moves, only Bismarck stood by him.
Finally, it all paid off: In 1851 Bismarck was made a minister in the
king’s cabinet. Now he went to work. Time and again he forced the king’s
hand, getting him to build up the military, to stand up to the liberals, to do
exactly as Bismarck wished. He worked on Frederick’s insecurity about his
manliness, challenging him to be firm and to rule with pride. And he
slowly restored the king’s powers until the monarchy was once again the
most

powerful force in Prussia.

When Frederick died, in 1861, his brother William assumed the
throne. William disliked Bismarck intensely and had no intention of keep

ing him around. But he also inherited the same situation his brother had:

lnterpretalion
Most young and ambitious politicians looking out on the political landscape
of 18405 Germany would have tried to build a power base among those
with the most power. Bismarck saw different. Joining forces with the powerful can be foolish: They will swallow you up, just as the (loge of Venice

swallowed up the Count of Carmagnola. No one will come to depend on
you if they are already strong. If you are ambitious, it is much wiser to seek
out weak rulers or masters with whom you can create a relationship of do

pendency. You become their strength, their intelligence, their spine. What
power you hold! If they got rid of you the whole edifice would collapse.

Necessity rules the world. People rarely act unless compelled to. If you
yourself, then you will be done away with at first oppor-

create no need for

tunity. If, on the other hand, you understand the Laws of Power and make
others depend on you for their welfare, if you can counteract their weak»
your own “iron and blood,” in Bisrn-arck’s phrase, then you will
survive your masters as Bismarck did, You will have all the benefits of

ness with

power without the thorns that come from being a master.
Thus a wise prince will think ofways to keep his citizens of every sort
and under every circumstance dependent on the state and on him;
and than they will always be trustworthy.

The ultimate power is the power to get people to do as you wish. When you

supw-/izmzis lmglli:
cullilig on her m'igI1~

can

do this without having to force people or hurt them, when they will»

ingly grant you what you desire, then your power is untouchable. The best
way to achieve this position is to create a. relationship of dependence. The
master requires your services; he is weak,

or

unable to function without

you; you have enmeshed yourself in his work so deeply that doing away
with you would bring him great difficulty, or at least would mean valuable
time lost in training another to replace you. Once such a relationship is es-

tablished you have the upper hand, the leverage to make the master do as
you wish. It is the classic case of the man behind the throne, the servant of
the king who actually controls the king. Bismarck did not have to bully ei-

ther Frederick or William into doing his bidding. He simply made it clear
that unless he got what he wanted he would walk away, leaving the king to
twist in the wind. Both kings soon danced to Bismarck’s tune.

Do not be one of the many who mistakenly believe that the ultimate
form of power is independence. Power involves a relationship between

people; you will always need others as allies, pawns, or even as weak mas
ters who serve as your front. The completely independent man would live

in a cabin in the woods«—~he would have the freedom to come and go as he

pleased, but he would have no power. The best you can hope for is that
others will grow so dependent on you that you enjoy a kind of reverse independence: Their need for you frees you.
Louis XI (1423-1483), the great Spider King of France, had a weakness for
astrology. He kept a court astrologer whom he admired, until one

One evening Louis summoned the astrologer to his room, high in the
castle. Before the man arrived, the king told his servants that when he gave

the signal they were to pick the astrologer up, carry him to the window,

and hurl him to the ground, hundreds of feet below.
The astrologer soon arrived, but before giving the signal, Louis decided to ask him one last question: “You claim to understand astrology and
to know the fate of others, so tell me what your fate will be and how long

you have to live.”
“I shall die just three days before Your Majesty," the astrologer replied.
The kings signal was never given. The man’s life was spared. The Spider

King not only protected his astrologer for as long as he was alive, he lavished him with gifts and had him tended by the finest court doctors.
The astrologer survived Louis by several years, disproving his power
of prophecy but proving his mastery of power.
This is the model: Make others dependent on you. To get rid of you
might spell disaster, even death, and your master dares not tempt fate by
finding out. There are many ways to obtain such a position. Foremost
among them is to possess a talent and creative skill that simply cannot be
replaced.
During the Renaissance, the major obstacle to a pajntefls success was
finding the right patron. Michelangelo did this better than anyone else: His
patron was Pope julius H. But he and the pope quarreled over the building
of the pope’s marble ‘comb, and Michelangelo left Rome in disgust To the
amazement of those in the pope’s circle, not only did the pope not fire him,
he sought him out and in his own haughty way begged the artist to stay.
Michelangelo, he knew, could find another patron, but he could never find
another Michelangelo.
You do not have to have the talent of 3. Michelangelo; you do have to
have a skill that sets you apart from the crowd. You should create a situation in which you can always latch on to another master or patron but your
master cannot easily find another servant with your particular talent. And

if, in reality, you are not actually indispensable, you must find a way to
make it look as if you are. Having the appearance of specialized knowledge

and skill gives you leeway in your ability to deceive those above you into

thinking they cannot do without you. Real dependence on your master’s
part, however, leaves him more vulnerable to you than the faked variety,
and it is always within your power to make your skill indispensable.
This is what is meant by the intertwining of fates: Like creeping ivy,
you have wrapped yourself around the source of power, so that it would
cause
great trauma to cut you away. And you do not necessarily have to entwine yourself around the master; another person will do, as long as he or

she too is indispensable in the chain.
One day Harry Colin, president of Columbia Pictures, was visited in
his office by a gloomy group of his executives. It was 1951, when the witch-

hunc against Communists in Hollywood, carried on by the US. Congress’s
House Un-American Activities Committee, was at its height. The executives had bad news: One of their employees, the screenwriterjolm Howard

Lawson, had been singled out as a Communist. They had to get rid of him

night away or suffer the wrath of the committee.

Harry Cohn was no bleeding—heart liberal; in fact, he had always been
a diehard
Republican.
His favorite politician was Benito Mussolini, whom he had once visited, and whose framed photo hung on his wall. If there was someone he
hated Cohn would call him a “Communist bastard.” But to the executives’
amazement Cohn told them he would not fire Lawson. He did not

keep the

screenwriter on because he was a good Writer—there were many good
writers in Hollywood. He kept him because of a chain of dependence:

Lawson was Humphrey Bogart’s writer and Bogart was Columbia’s star. If

Cohn messed with Lawson he would ruin an immensely profitable rela-

tionship. That was worth more than the terrible publicity brought to him
by his defiance of the committee.
Henry Kissinger managed to survive the many bloodlettings that went
on in the Nixon White House not because he was the best
diplomat Nixon
could find—there were other fine negotiators»--and not because the two
men
got along so well: They did not. Nor did they share their beliefs and
politics. Kissinger survived because he entrenched himself in so many
areas of the
political structure that to do away with him would lead to
chaos. Michelangelds power was intensive, depending on one skill, his ability as an artist; Kissinger’s was extensive. He got himself involved in so
many aspects and departments of the administration that his involvement
became a card in his hand. It also made him many allies. If you can
arrange such a position for yourself, getting rid of you becomes
dangerous—all sorts of interdependencies will unravel. Still, the intensive
form of power provides more freedom than the extensive, because those
who have it depend on no particular master, or particular position of
power, for their security.
To make others dependent on you, one route to take is the secret-

intelligence tactic. By knowing other people’s secrets, by holding information that they wouldn’t want broadcast, you seal your fate with theirs. You
are untouchable. Ministers of secret

the power it provides almost cancels itself out. You cannot rest at ease, and
what good is power if it brings you no peace?

One last warning: Do not imagine that your master’s dependence on
you will make him love you. In fact, he may resent and fear you. But, as
Machiavelli said, it is better to be feared than loved. Fear you can control;

love, never. Depending on an emotion as subtle and changeable as love or

friendship will only make you insecure. Better to have others depend on
you out of fear of the consequences of losing you than out of love of your
company.

REVERSAL
The weakness of making others depend on you is that you are in some
measure dependent on them. But trying to move beyond that point means
getting rid of those above you—it means standing alone, depending on no
one. Such is the
monopolistic drive of a_]. P. Morgan or ajohn D. Rockefeller———to drive out all competition, to be in complete control. If you can
corner the market, so much the better.
No such independence comes without a price. You are forced to isolate

yourself. Monopolies often turn inward and destroy themselves from the internal pressure. They also stir up powerful resentment, making their enemies bond together to fight them. The drive for complete control is often
ruinous and fruitless. Interdependence remains the law, independence a
rare and often fatal
exception. Better to place yourself in a. position of mutual dependence, then, and to follow this critical law rather than look for its
reversal. You will not have the unbearable pressure of being on top, and the
master above you will in essence be your slave, for kewill depend on you.

Interpretation
Count Victor Lustig, a man who spoke several languages and prided him-

self on his refinement and culture, was one of the great con arfists of modern

times. He

was

known for his audacity, his fearlessness, and, most

important, his knowledge of human psychology. He could size up a man in
minutes, discovering his weaknesses, and he had radar for suckers. Lustig
knew that most men build up defenses against crooks and other troublemakers. The con artists job is to bring those defenses down.

One sure way to do this is through an act of apparent sincerity and

honesty. Who will distrust a person literally caught in the act of being hon0

est? Lustig used selective honesty many times, but with Capone he went a

step further. No normal con man would have dared such a con; he would
have chosen his suckers for their meekness, for that look about them that
says they will take their medicine without complaint. Con Capone and you
would spend the rest of your life (whatever remained of it) afraid. But

Lustig understood that a man like Capone spends his life rrfistrusting others.

No one around him is honest or generous, and being so much in the

company of wolves is exhausting, even depressing. A man like Capone
yearns to be the recipient of an honest or generous gesture, to feel that not
everyone has an angle or is out to rob him.
Lusiig’s act of selective honesty disarmed Capone because it was so

unexpected. A con artist loves conflicting emotions like these, since the
person caught up in them is so easily distracted and deceived.
Do not shy away from practicing this law on the Capones of the world.
With a well-timed gesture of honesty or generosity, you will have the most
brutal and cynical beast in the kingdom eating out of your hand.

KEYS ’l‘(.) P()\/\"l:lR

The essence of deception is distraction. Distracting the people you want to
deceive gives you the time and space to do something they won’: notice.
An act of kindness, generosity, or honesty is often the most powerful form
of distraction because it disanns other people’s suspicions. It tums them
into children, eagerly lapping up any kind of a.ft'ectiona.te gesture.
In ancient China this was called “giving before you take”--the giving
makes it hard for the other person to notice the taldng. It is a device with

infinite practical uses. Brazenly taking something from someone is dangerous, even for the powerful. The victim will plot revenge. It is also danger-

simply to ask for what you need, no matter how politely: Unless the
other person sees some gain for themselves, they may come to resent your
ous

neediness. Learn to give before you take. It softens the ground, takes the
bite out of a future request, or simply creates a distraction. And the giving
many forms: an actual gift, at generous act, a kind favor, an “l1on~
est” admission-—whatever it takes.
can take

Selective honesty is best employed on your first encounter with some
one. We are all creatures of

habit, and our first impressions last a long time.

If someone believes you are honest at the start of your relationship it takes
a lot to convince them otherwise. This

gives you room to maneuver.
jay Gould, like Al Capone, was a man who distrusted everyone.
By the time he was thirty—three he was already a multimillionaire,
mostly through deception and strong-arming. In the late 1860s, Gould invested heavily in the Erie Railroad, then discovered that the market had
L/SW12

91

been flooded with a vast amount of phony stock certificates for the com»

party. He stood to lose a fortune and to suffer a lot of embarrassment.
In the midst of this crisis, a man named Lord john Gordon- Gordon offered to help. Gordon—Gordon, a Scottish lord, had apparently made a
small fortune investing in railroads.

By hiring some handwriting experts 'Gordon—Gordon was able to
prove to Gould that the culprits for the phony stock certificates were actually several top executives with the Erie Railroad itself. Gould was grateful.

Gordon«Gordon then proposed that he and Gould join forces to buy up a

controlling interest in Erie. Gould agreed. For a while the venture appeared to prosper. The two men were now good friends, and every time
Gordon—Gordon came to Gould asking for money to buy more stock,
Gould gave it to him. In 1873, however, Gordon-Gordon suddenly
dumped all of his stock, making a fortune but drastically lowering the value
of Gould’s own holdings. Then he disappeared from sight.
Upon investigation, Gould found out that Gordon-Gordon’s real name
was
john Crowningsfield, and that he was the bastard son of a merchant
Seaman and a London barmaid. There had been many clues before

then

that Goi-donvGordon was a con man, but his initial act of honesty and sup

port had so blinded Gould that it took the loss of millions for him to see

through the scheme.
A single act of honesty is often not enough. What is required is a reputation for honesty, built on a. series of acts-—but these can be quite inconsequential. Once this reputation is established, as with first impressions, it is
hard to shake.

~

In ancient China, Duke Wu of Chéng decided it was time to take over

the increasingly powerful kingdom of Ho. Telling no one of his plan, he
married his daughter to Hu’s ruler. He then called a oouncil and asked his

ministers, “I am considering a military campaign. Which country should
we invade?” As he had

expected, one of his ministers replied, “H11 should

be invaded.” The duke seemed angry, and said, “Hu is a sister state now.

Why do you suggest invading her?” He had the minister executed for his
impolitic remark. The ruler of Hu heard about this, and considering other
tokens of Wu’s honesty and the marriage with his daughter, he took no precautions to defend himself from Chéng. A few weeks later, Chéng forces
swept through Hu and took the country, never to relinquish it.
Honesty is one of the best ways to disarm the wary, but it is not the
only one. Any kind of noble, apparently selfless act will serve. Perhaps the
best such act, though, is one of generosity. Few people can resist a gift, even
from the most hardened enemy, which is why it is often the perfect way to
disarm people. A gift brings out the child in us, instantly lowering our dc»
lenses. Although we often view other people’s actions in the most cynical
light, we rarely see the Machiavellian element of a gift, which quite often
hides ulterior motives. A gift is the perfect object in which to hide a decep—
live move.

One gift did more for the Greek cause than ten years of fighting.
Selective kindness should also be part of your arsenal of deception. For
years the ancient Romans had besieged the city of the Faliscans, always un~
successfully. One day, however, when the Roman general Camillus was

encamped outside the city, he suddenly saw a man leading some children
toward him. The man was a Faliscan teacher, and the children, it turned

out, were the sons and daughters of the noblest and wealthiest citizens of
the town. On the pretense of taking these children out for a walk, he had
led them straight to the Romans, offering them as hostages in hopes of in-

gratiating himself with Camillus, the city’s enemy.
Camillus did not take the children hostage. He stripped the teadier,
tied his hands behind his back, gave each child a rod, and let them whip
him all the way back to the city. The gesture had an immediate effect on

the Faliscans. Had Camillus used the children as hostages, some in the city
would have voted to surrender. And even if the Faliscans had gone on

fighting, their resistance would have been halfhearted. Camillus’s refusal to
take advantage of the situation broke down the Faliscans’ resistance, and
they surrendered. The general had calculated correctly. And in any case he
had had nothing to lose: He knew that the hostage ploy would not have
ended the war, at least not right away. By turning the situation around, he
earned his enemy’s trust and respecg disarming them. Selective kindness
will often break down even the most stubborn foe: Aiming right for the

heart, it corrodes the will to fight back.

REVERSAL

When you have a history of deceit behind you, no amount of honesty, gen-

erosity, or kindness will fool people. In fact it will only call attention to itself. Once people have come to see you as deceitful, to act honest all of a
sudden is simply suspicious. In these cases it is better to play the rogue.
Count Lustig, pulling the biggest can of his career, was about to sell
the Eiffel Tower to an unsuspecting indusixialist who believed the government was

auctioning it off for scrap metal. The industrialist was prepared

to hand over a huge sum of money to Lustig, who had successfully imper-

sonated a government official. At the last minute, however, the mark was

suspicious. Something about Lustig bothered him. At the meeting in which
he was to hand over the money, Lustig sensed his sudden distrust.

Leaning over to the industrialist, Lustig explained, in a low whisper,
how low his salary was, how difficult his finances were, on and on. After a
few minutes of this, the industlialist realized that Lustig was asking for a
bribe. For the first time he relaxed. Now he knew he could trust Lustig:

Since all government officials were dishonest, Lustig had to be real. The
forked over the money. By acting dishonest, Lustig seemed the real

McCoy. In this case selective honesty would have had the opposite effect.
As the French diplomat Talleyrand grew older, his reputation as a master liar and deceiver spread. At the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), he
would spin fabulous stories and make impossible remarlm to people who
knew he had to be lying. His dishonesty had no purpose except to cloak
the moments when he really was deceiving them. One day, for example,
among friends, Talleyrand said with apparent sincerity, “In business one
ought to show one’s hand.” No one who heard him could believe their
ears:

A man who never once in his life had shown his cards was telling

other people to show theirs. Tactics like this made it impossible to distin-

guish Talleyi-and’s real decepfions from his fake ones. By embracing his
reputation for dishonesty, he preserved his ability to deceive.

When news of the rebellion reached Castruccio, he hurried back to
Lucca. By the time he arrived, however, the fighting had ceased, through
Stefa.no’s agency, and he was surprised by the city’s calm and peace. Stefano di Poggio had imagined that Castruccio would be grateful to him for

his part in quelling the rebellion, so he paid the prince a visit. He explained
how he had brought peace, then begged for Castruccio’s mercy. He said
that the rebels in his family were young and impetuous, hungry for power

yet inexperienced; he recalled his family’s past generosity to Castzuccio.
For all these reasons, he said, the great prince should pardon the Poggios
and listen to their complaints. This, he said, was the only just thing to do,
since the family had willingly laid down their arms and had always sup-

ported him.
Castmccio listened patiently. He seemed not the slightest bit angry or
resentful. Instead, he told Stefano to rest assured that justice would prevail,
and he asked him to bring his entire family to the palace to talk over their

grievances and come to an agreement. As they took leave of one another,
Castruccio said he thanked God for the chance he had been given to show
his clemency and kindness. That evening the entire Poggio family came to
the palace. Castruccio immediately had them imprisoned and a few days
later all were executed, including Stefano.

treachery and ruthlessness. This was a man, after all, who had put a close

terrible wrong to kill such an old friend, he replied that he had executed
not an old friend but a new enemy.

of his obligations to the Poggios by eliminating the Poggios.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 4-33 B.C., just before the Peloponnesian War, the island of Corcyra (later
called Corfu) and the Greek city~state of Corinth stood on the brink of con-

flict. Both parties sent ambassadors to Athens to try to win over the Atheni~
ans to their side. The stakes were

high, since whoever had Athens on his

side was sure to win. And whoever won the war would certainly give the
defeated side no mercy.

Corcyra spoke first. Its ambassador began by admitting that the island
had never helped Athens before, and in fact had allied itself with Athens’s
enemies. There were no ties of friendship or gratitude between Corcyra

and Athens. Yes, the ambassador achnitted, he had come to Athens now

Corcyra’s safety. The only thing he could offer
was an alliance of mutual interests. Corcyra had a navy only
surpassed in
size and strength by Athens’s own; an alliance between the two states
out of fear and concern for

would create a formidable force, one that could intimidate the rival state of
Sparta. That, unfortunately, was all Oorcyra had to offer.
The

representative from Corinth then gave a brilliant, passionate

speech, in sharp contrast to the dry, colorless approach of the Corcyran.
He talked of everything Corinth had done for Athens in the past. He asked

how it would look to Athens’s other allies if the city put an agreement with
a

former enemy over one with

a

present friend, one that had served

Athens’s interest loyally: Perhaps those allies would break their agreements
with Athens if they saw that their loyalty was not valued. He referred to
Hellenic law, and the need to repay Corinth for all its good deeds. He fi-

nally went on to list the many services Corinth had performed for Athens,
and the importance of showing gratitude to one’s friends.
After the speech, the Athenians debated the issue in an assembly. On
LAW I3

97

the second round, they voted overwhelmingly to ally with Corcyra and

drop Corinth.
Interpretation
History has remembered the Athenians nobly, but they were the preeminent realists of classical Greece. With them, all the rhetoric, all the emotional appeals in the world, could not match a good pragmatic argument,

especially one that added to their power.
What the Corinthian ambassador did not realize was that his referCorinth’s past generosity to Athens only irritated the Athenians,
subtly asking them to feel guilty and putting them under obligation. The
Athenians couldn’t care less about past favors and friendly feelings. At the
same time, they knew that if their other allies thought them ungrateful for
abandoning Corinth, these city-states would still be unlikely to break their
ties to Athens, the preeminent power in Greece. Athens ruled its empire by
force, and would simply compel any rebellious ally to return to the fold.
When people choose between talk about the past and talk about the
future, a pragmatic person will always opt for the future and forget the past.

As the Corcyrans realized, it is always best to speak pragmatically to a

pragmatic person. And in the end, most people are in fast pragmatic-—they
will rarely act against their own self-interest.

KEYS TO POWER

In your quest for power, you will constantly find yourself in the position of

asking for help from those more powerful than you. There is an art to asking for help, an art that depends on your ability to understand the person
you are dealing with, and to not confuse your needs with theirs.
Most people never succeed at this, because they are completely
trapped in their own wants and desires. They start from the assumption
that the people they are appealing to have a selfless interest in helping
them. They talk as if their needs mattered to these peopleowho probably
couldn’t care less. Sometimes they refer to larger issues: a great cause, or
grand emotions such as love and gratitude. They go for the big picture
when simple, everyday realities would have much more appeal. What they
do not realize is that even the most powerful person is locked inside needs
of his own, and that if you make no appeal to his selfdnterest, he merely
sees you as desperate or, at best, a waste of time.

In the sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries tried for years to con
vert the

people ofjapan to Catholicism, while at the same time Portugal

had a monopoly on trade between japan and Europe. Although the missionaries did have some success, they never got far among the ruling elite;

by the beginning of the seventeenth century, in fact, their proselytizing had
completely antagonized the Japanese emperor Ieyasu. When the Dutch
began to arrive in japan in great numbers, Ieyasu was much relieved. He
needed Europeans for their know-how in guns and navigation, and here at
last were Europeans who cared nothing for spreading religion——the Dutch
wanted only to trade. Ieyasu swiftly moved to evict the Portuguese. From
then on, he would only deal with the practicalminded Dutch.

Japan and Holland were vastly different cultures, but each shared a
timeless and universal concern: selfiinterest. Every person you deal with is

like another culuire, an alien land with a past that has nothing to do with
yours. Yet you can bypass the differences between you and him by appealing to his self—interest. Do not be subtle: You have valuable knowledge to

share, you will fill his coffers with gold, you will make him live longer and

happier. This is a language that all of us speak and understand.
A key step in the process is to understand the other person’s psychol~

ogy. Is he vain? Is he concerned about his reputation or his social standing?
Does he have enemies you could help him vanquish? Is he simply mod»
vated by money and power?
When the Mongols invaded China in the twelfth century, they threab

erred to obliterate a culture that had thrived for over two thousand years.
Their leader, Genghis Khan, saw nothing in China. but a country that
lacked pasturing for his horses, and he decided to destroy the place, IeveI~

ing all its cities, for “it would be better to exterminate the Chinese and let
the grass grow.” It was not a soldier, a. general, or a king who saved the
Chinese from devastation, but a man named Yelu Ch’u—Ts’ai. A foreigner
himself, Ch’u«Ts’ai had come to appreciate the superiority of Chinese culture. He managed to make himself a trusted adviser to Genghis Khan, and
persuaded him that he would reap riches out of the place if, instead of de
straying it, he simply taxed everyone who lived there. Khan saw the wisdom in this and did as Ch’u—Ts‘a.i advised.
When Khan took the city of Kaifeng, after a long siege, and decided to
massaxtre

its inhabitants (as he had in other cities that had resisted him),

Ch’u~Ts’ai told him that the finest craftsmen and engineers in China had
fled to Kaifeng, and it would be better to put them to use. Kaifeng was

spared. Never before had Genghis Khan shown such mercy, but then it
really wasn’t mercy that saved Kaifeng. Ch‘u—Ts’ai knew Khan well. He was
a barbaric peasant who cared nothing for culuire, or indeed for anything
other than warfare and practical results. Ch’u—Ts’ai chose to appeal to the

only emotion that would work on such a man: greed.

Some people will see an appeal to their selfiinterest as ugly and ignoble.

that intoxicates them. They are dying to fund your project, to introduce
you to powerful people———provided, of course, that all this is done in public,
and for a good cause (usually the more public, the better). Not everyone,

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW

Joseph Duveen was undoubtedly the greatest art dealer of his time—from
1904 to 194-0 he almost single—handedly rnonopolized America’s millionaire art-collecting market. But one prize plum eluded him: the industrialist
Andrew Mellon. Before he died, Duveen was determined to make Mellon
a

client.
Duveen’s friends said this was an impossible dreani. Mellon was a stiff,

taciturn man. The stories he had heard about the congenial, talkative Duveen rubbed him the

wrong way—-he had made it clear he had no desire to
doubting friends, “Not only will Mellon

meet the man. Yet Duveen told his

buy from me but he will buy only from me.” For several years he tracked
his prey, learning the man’s habits, tastes, phobias. To do this, he secretly
put several of Mellon’s staff on his own payroll, worming valuable information out of them. By the time he moved into action, he knew Mellon about
as well as Mellon’s wife did.

In 1921 Mellon was visiting London, and staying in a palatial suite on

the third floor of Claridge’s Hotel. Duveen booked himself into the suite

just below Mellon’s, on the second floor. He had arranged for his valet to
befriend Mellon’s valet, and on the fateful day he had chosen to make his
move, Mellon’s valet told Duveen’s valet, who told Duveen, that he had

just helped Mellon on with his overcoat, and that the industrialist was making his way down the corridor to ring for the lift.
Duveen’s valet hurriedly helped Duveen with his own overcoat. Sec»
onds later, Duveen entered the lift, and lo and behold, there was Mellon.
“How do you do, Mr. Mellon?” said Duveen, introducing himself. “I am on
my way to the National Gallery to look at some pictures.” How uncannythat was precisely where Mellon was headed. And so Duveen was able to
accompany his prey to the one location that would ensure his success. He
knew Mellon’s taste inside and out, and while the two men wandered

through the museum, he dazzled the magnate with his knowledge. Once
again quite uncannily, they seemed to have remarkably similar tastes.
Mellon was pleasantly surprised: This was not the Duveen he had expected. The man was charming and agreeable, and clearly had exquisite
taste. When they returned to New York, Mellon visited Duveen’s exclusive
gallery and fell in love with the collection. Everything, surprisingly enough,
seemed to be precisely the kind of work he wanted to collect. For the rest
of his life he was Duveen’s best and most generous client.

Interpretation
A man as ambitious and competitive as Joseph Duveen left nothing to

chance. What’s the point of winging ig of just hoping you may be able to
charm this or that client? It’s like shooting ducks blindfolded. Arm yourself

with a little knowledge and your aim improves.
Mellon was the most spectacular of Duveen’s catches, but he spied on
many a millionaire. By secretly putting members of his clients’ household
staffs on his own payroll, he would gain constant access to valuable infor-

I02

LAW 14

mation about their masters’

comings and goings, changes in taste, and
other such tidbits of information that would put him a step ahead. A rival
of Duveen’s who wanted to make Henry Frick a client noticed that whenever

he visited this wealthy New Yorker, Duveen was there before him, as

if he had a sixth sense. To other dealers Duveen seemed to be everywhere,
and to know everything before they did. His powers discouraged and dis-

heartened them, until many simply gave up going after the wealthy clients
who could make a dealer rich.
Such is the power of artful spying: It makes you seem all—powerful,
clairvoyant. Your knowledge of your mark can also make you seem charm-

ing, so well can you anticipate his desires. No one sees the source of your
power, and what they cannot see they cannot fight.
Rulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Bmhmins through

scriptures and the rest of the people through their normal eyes.

KEYS TO POWER
In the realm of power, your goal is a degree of control over future events.
Part of the problem you face, then, is that people won’t tell you all their

thoughts, emotions, and plans. Controlling what they say, they often keep
the most critical parts of their character hidden—their weaknesses, ulterior

motives, obsessions. The result is that you cannot predict their moves, and
are

constantly in the dark. The trick is to find a way to probe them, to find
and hidden intentions, without letting them know what

out their secrets

you are up to.
This is not as difficult as you might think. A friendly front will let you

secretly gather information on friends and enemies alike. Let others consult the horoscope, or read tarot cards: You have more concrete means of
seeing into the future.
The most common way of spying is to use other people, as Duveen
did. The method is simple, powerful, but risky: You will certainly gather information, but you have little control over the people who are doing the
work. Perhaps they will ineptly reveal your spying, or even secretly turn
against you. It is far better to be the spy yourself, to pose as a friend while

secretly gathering information.
The French politician Talleyrand was one of the greatest practitioners
of this art. He had an uncanny ability to worm secrets out of people in palite conversation. A contemporary of his, Baron de Vitrolles, wrote, “Wit
and grace marked his conversation. He possessed the art of concealing his

thoughts or his malice beneath a transparent veil of insinuations, words
that imply something more than they express. Only when necessary did he

inject his own personality.” The key here is Talleyrand’s ability to suppress
himself in the conversation, to make others talk endlessly about themselves
and inadvertently reveal their intentions and plans.

tionalist—yet he actually said very little. He never talked about his own
ideas; he got others to reveal theirs. He would organize friendly games of
charades for foreign diplomats, social gatherings where, however, he
would carefully weigh their words, cajole confidences out of them, and

gather information invaluable to his work as France’s foreign minister. At
the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) he did his spying in other ways: He
would blurt out what seemed to be a secret (actually something he had
made up), then watch his listeners’ reactions. He might tell a gathering of
diplomats, for instance, that a reliable source had revealed to him that the
czar of Russia was planning to arrest his top general for treason. By watching the diplomats’ reactions to this madealp story, he would know which
ones were most excited
by the weakening of the Russian army—~perhaps
their goverments had designs on Russia? As Baron Von Stetten said,
“Monsieur Talleyrand fires a pistol into the air to see who will jump out the
window.”

During social gatherings and innocuous encounters, pay attention.
This is when people’s guards are down. By suppressing your own personality, you can make them reveal things. The brilliance of the maneuver is
that they will mistake your interest in them for friendship, so that you not

only learn, you malce allies.
Nevertheless, you should practice this tactic with caution and care. If

people begin to suspect you are worming secrets out of them under the
cover of conversation, they will strictly avoid you. Emphasize friendly
chatter, not valuable information. Your search for gems of information cannot be too obvious, or your
probing questions will reveal more about your
self and your intentions than about the information you hope to find.
A trick to try in spying comes from La Rochefoucauld, who wrote,

“Sincerity is found in very few men, and is often the cleverest of ruses——
one is sincere in order to draw out the confidence and secrets of the other.”

By pretending to bare your heart to another person, in other words, you
make them more likely to reveal their own secrets. Give them a false con‘
fession and they will give you a real one. Another trick was identified by
the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who suggested vehemently contradicting people you’re in conversation with as a way of irritating them, stir—
ring them up so that they lose some of the control over their words. In their
emotional reaction they will reveal all kinds of truths about themselves,
truths you can later use against them.
Another method of indirect spying is to test people, to lay little traps
that make them reveal things about themselves. Chosroes II, a notoriously

clever seventlrcentury king of the Persians, had many ways of seeing

through his subjects without raising suspicion. If he noticed, for instance,
that two of his couruers had become particularly friendly, he would call
one of them aside and

say he had information that the other was a traitor,
and would soon be killed. The king would tell the courtier he tmsted him
more than anyone, and that he must

104

LAW 14

keep this information secret. Then he

would watch the two men carefully. If he saw that the second courtier had
not

changed in his behavior toward the king, he would conclude that the

first courtier had kept the secret, and he would quickly promote the man,

later taking him aside to confess, “I meant to kill your friend because of
certain information that had reached me, but, when I investigated the mat-

ter, I found it was untrue.” If, on the other hand, the second courtier started
to avoid the king, acting aloof and tense, Chosroes would know that the se
cret had been revealed. He would ban the second courtier from his court,

letting him know that the whole business had only been a test, but that
even
though the man had done nothing wrong, he could no longer trust
him. The first courtier, however, had revealed a secret, and him Chosroes
would ban from his entire kingdom.
It may seem an odd form of spying that reveals not empirical informa:
tion but a person’s character. Often, however, it is the best way of solving

problems before they arise.
By tempting people into certain acts, you learn about their loyalty,
their honesty, and so on. And this kind of knowledge is often the most
valuable of all: Armed with it, you can predict their actions in the future.

REVERSAL

Information is critical to power, but just as you spy on other people, you
must be prepared for them to spy on you. One of the most potent weapons

in the battle for information, then, is giving out false information. As Mnston

Churchill said, “Truth is so precious that she should always be at»

tended by a bodyguard of lies.” You must surround yourself with such a
bodyguard, so that your truth cannot be penetrated. By planting the information of your choice, you control the game.

In 1944 the Nazis’ rocket-bomb attacks on London suddenly escalated.

Over two thousand V-1 flying bombs fell on the city, killing more than five
thousand people and wounding many more, Somehow, however, the Germans

consistently missed their targets. Bombs that were intended for

Tower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall well short of the city, landing in the

less populated suburbs. This was because, in fixing their targets, the Germans

relied on secret agents they had planted in England. They did not

know that these agents had been

English—c0ntrolled agents

were

discovered, and that in their place,

feeding them subtly deceptive information.

The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time

they fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows in the
country. By feeding people wrong information, then, you gain a potent ad
vantage. While spying gives you a third eye, disinformation puts out one of
your enemy’s eyes. A cyclops, he always misses his target.

No rivalry between leaders is more celebrated in Chinese history than the

struggle between Hsiang Yu and Liu Pang. These two generals began their
careers as friends,
fighting on the same side. Hsiang Yu came from the noand

preferred women and wine to fighting; in fact, he was some
thing of a scoundrel. But he was wily, and he had the ability to recognize
the best strategists, keep them as his advisers, and listen to their advice. He
had risen in the army through these strengths.
In 208 13.0., the king of Ch’u sent two massive armies to conquer the
powerful kingdom of Ch’in. One army went north, under the generalship
of Sung Yi, with Hsiang Yu second in command; the other, led by Liu
Pang, headed straight toward Ch’in. The target was the kingdom’s splendid
capital, Hsien-yang. And Hsiang Yu, ever violent and impatient, could not
stand the idea that Liu Pang would get to Hsietryang first, and perhaps
would assume command of the entire anny.
At one point on the northern front, Hsiang’s commander, Sung Yi,

hesitated in sending his troops into battle. Furious, Hsiang entered Sung
Yi’s tent, proclaimed him a traitor, cut off his head, and assumed sole com~

mand of the army. Without waiting for orders, he left the northern front
and marched directly on Hsien—yang. He felt certain he was the better soldier and general than Liu, but, to his utter astonishment, his rival, leading a

smaller, swifter army, managed to reach Hsien-yang first. Hsiang had an
adviser, Fan Tseng, who warned him, “This village headman [Liu Fang]
used to be greedy only for riches and women, but since entering the capital
he has not been led astray by wealth, wine, or sex. That shows he is aiming

high.”
Fan Tseng urged Hsiang to kill his rival before it was too late. He told
the general to invite the wily peasant to a banquet at their camp outside

“One cannot plan with 3. simpleton. Liu Pang will steal your empire yet

him for many months, finally cornering him in a walled city. Lacking food,
his army in disarray, Liu sued for peace.

Again Fan Tseng wamed Hsiang, “Crush him now! If you let him go

again, you will be sorry later.” But Hsiang decided to be merciful. He
wanted to bring Liu back to Ch’u alive, and to force his former friend to ac-

knowledge him as master. But Fan proved right: Liu managed to use the
negotiations for his surrender as a distraction, and he escaped with a small
army. Hsiang, amazed that he had yet again let his rival slip away, once
more set out after Liu, this time with such
ferocity that he seemed to have
lost his mind. At one point, having captured Liu’s father in battle, Hsiang
stood the old man up during the fighting and yelled to Liu across the line of
troops, “Surrender now, or I shall boil your father alive!” Liu calmly arr
swered, “But we are sworn brothers. So my father is your father also. If you
insist on boiling your own father, send me a bowl of the soup!” Hsiang
backed down, and the struggle continued.
A few weeks later, in the thick of the hunt, Hsiang scattered his forces
unwisely, and in a surprise attack Liu was able to surround his main garrison. For the first time the tables were turned. Now it was

Hsiang who sued

for peace. Liu’s top adviser urged him to destroy Hsiang, crush his army,

show no mercy. “To let him go would be like rearing a tiger——it will devour
you later,” the adviser said. Liu agreed.
Making a false treaty, he lured Hsiarig into relaxing his defense, then

slaughtered almost all of his army. Hsiang managed to escape. Alone and
on foot, knowing that Liu had put a bounty on his head, he came upon a
small group of his own retreating soldiers, and cried out, “I hear Liu Pang
has offered one thousand pieces of gold and a fief of ten thousand families
for my head. Let me do you a favor.” Then he slit his own throat and died.

Interpretation
Hsiang Yu had proven his ruthlessness on many an occasion. He rarely
hesitated in doing away with a rival if it served his purposes. But with Liu
Pang he acted differently. He respected his rival, and did not want to defeat
him through deception; he wanted to prove his superiority on the battle
field, even to force the clever Liu to surrender and to serve him. Every time
he had his rival in his hands, something made him hesitat&——a fatal sympa~
thy with or respect for the man who, after all, had once been a friend and
comrade in arms. But the moment Hsiang made it clear that he intended to
do away with Liu, yet failed to accomplish it, he sealed his own doom. Liu
would not suffer the same hesitation once the tables were tamed.
This is the fate that faces all of us when we sympathize with our ene

mics, when pity, or the hope of reconciliation, makes us pull back from
doing away with them. We only strengthen their fear and hatred of us. We
have beaten them, and they are humiliated; yet we nurture these resentful

vipers who will one day kill us. Power cannot be dealt with this way. It
must be exterrninated, crushed, and denied the chance to return to haunt

This is all the truer with a former friend who has become an enemy.
The law governing fatal antagonisnis reads: Reconciliation is out of the
us.

question. Only one side can win, and it must win totally.
Liu Pang learned this lesson well. After defeating Hsiang Yu, this son

The imperial harem was a dangerous place, full of young concubines
vying to become the emperor’s favorite. Wu’s beauty and forceful character quickly won her this battle, but, knowing that an emperor, like other
powerful men, is a creature of whim, and that she could easily be replaced,
she kept her eye on the future.
Wu managed to seduce the emperor’s dissolute son, Kao Tsung, on the

only possible occasion when she could find him alone: while he was relieving himself at the royal urinal. Even so, when the emperor died and Ken
Tsung took over the throne, she still suffered the fate to which all wives and
concubines of a deceased emperor were bound by tradition and law: Her
head shaven, she entered a convent, for what was supposed to be the rest
of her life. For seven years Wu schemed to escape. By communicating in
secret with the new emperor, and by befiiencling his wife, the empress, she
managed to get a highly unusual royal edict allowing her to return to the
palace and to the royal harem. Once there, she fawned on the empress,
while still sleeping with the emperor. The empress did not discourage
this—--she had yet to provide the emperor with an heir, her position was
vulnerable, and Wu was a valuable ally.
In 654 Wu Chao gave birth to a child. One day the empress came to
visit, and as soon as she had left, Wu smothered the newborn——her own

baby. When the murder was discovered, suspicion immediately fell on the
empress, who had been on the scene moments earlier, and whose jealous
nature was known by all. This was precisely Wu’s plan. Shortly thereafter,
the empress was charged with murder and executed. Wu Chao was
crowned empress in her place. Her new husband, addicted to his life of
pleasure, gladly gave up the reins of government to Wu Chao, who was
from then on known as Empress Wu.
Although now in a position of great power, Wu hardly felt secure.
There were enemies everywhere; she could not let down her guard for one
moment. Indeed, when she was forty-one, she began to fear that her bean~
tiful young niece was becoming the emperor’s favorite. She poisoned the
woman with a clay mixed into her food. In 675 her own son, touted as the
110

,

LAW15

heir apparent, was poisoned as well. The next—eldest son———illegil:'ma.te, but
now

the crown prince——was exiled a little later on trumped—up charges.

And when the emperor died, in 683, Wu managed to have the son after
that declared unfit for the throne. All flris meant that it was her youngest,
most ineffectual son who

finally ‘became emperor. In this way she contin-

ued to rule.
Over the next five years there were innumerable palace coups. All of
them failed, and all of the conspirators were executed. By 688 there was no
one

left to challenge Wu. She proclaimed herself a divine descendant of

Buddha, and in 690 her wishes were finally granted: She was named Holy
and Divine “Emperor” of China.
Wu became emperor because there was literally nobody le-R from the

previous "Pang dynasty. And so she ruled unchallenged, for over a decade
of relative peace. In 705, at the age of eighty, she was forced to abdicate.

Interpretation
All who knew Empress Wu remarked on her energy and intelligence. At
the time, there was no glory available for an ambitious woman beyond a
few years in the imperial harem, then a lifetime walled up in a convent. In
Wu’s gradual but remarkable rise to the top, she was never naive. She
knew that any hesitation, any momentary weakness, would spell her and.

If, every time she got rid of a rival a new one appeared, the solution was

simple: She had to crush them all or be killed herself. Other emperors be
fore her had followed the same path to the top, but Wu-«who, as a woman,
had next to no chance to gain power———had to be more ruthless still.

Empress Wu’s forly—year reign was one of the longest in Chinese history. Although the story of her bloody rise to power is well known, in
China she is considered one of the period’s most able and effective rulers.
A priest asked the dying Spanish statesman and general Ramon Maria Narvdez

(1800-1868), “Does your Excellency forgive all your enemies?” “I do not
have to forgive my ene1nies,"anrwmed Narmiez, “I have had them all shat.

”

KEYS TO POWER
It is no accident that the two stories illustrating this law come from China:
Chinese history abounds with examples of enemies who were left alive and

returned to haunt the lenient. “Crush the enemy” is a key strategic tenet of

Surrtzu, the fourth—century—B.C. author of The Art ofl/Wzr. The idea is simple:
Your enemies wish you ill. There is nothing they want more than to eliminate you. If, in your struggles with them, you stop halfway or even three

quarters of the way, out of mercy or hope of reconciliation, you only make
them more determined, more embittered, and they will someday take revenge. They may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because
you have defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time.

The solution: Have no mercy. Crush your enemies as totally as they

LAW 15

I71

would crush you. Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for
from your enemies is their disappearance.

Mao Tse—tung, a devoted reader of Sun—tzu and of Chinese history gexr

erally, knew the importance of this law. In i934 the Communist leader and
some

75,000 poorly equipped soldiers fled into the desolate mountains of

western China to escape Chiang K.ai—shek’s much larger army, in what has

since been called the Long March.

Chiang was determined to eliminate every last Communist, and by a
10,000 soldiers left. By 1937, in fact,
when China was invaded by japan, Chiang calculated that the Communists were no longer a threat. He chose to give up the chase and conceir
trate on the Japanese. Ten years later the Communists had recovered
enough to rout Chia.ng’s army. Chiang had forgotten the ancient wisdom of
crushing the enemy; Mao had not. Chiang was pursued until he and his entire army fled to the island of Taiwan. Nothing remains of his regime in
mainland China to this day.
The wisdom behind “crushing the enemy” is as ancient as the Bible:
Its first practitioner may have been Moses, who learned it from God Him«
self, when He parted the Red Sea for the Jews, then let the water {low back
over the
pursuing Egyptians so that “not so much as one of them refew years later Mao had less than

mained.” When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with the Ten Cornmandments and found his people worshipping the Golden Calf, he had
every last offender slaughtered. And just before he died, he told his followers, finally about to enter the Promised Land, that when they had defeated

the tribes of Canaan they should “utterly destroy them

.

.

.

make no

covenant with them, and show no mercy to them.”

The goal of total victory is an axiom of modern warfare, and was codified as such by Carl von Clausewitz, the premier philosopher of war. Ana»

lyzing the campaigns of Napoleon, von Clausewitz wrote, “We do claim
that direct annihilation of the enemy’s forces must always be the dominant
consideration.

.

.

.

Once a major victory is achieved there must be no talk of

rest, of breathing space

.

.

.

but only of the pursuit, going for the enemy

again,
attacking his reserves and anything else that
aid
and comfort.” The reason for this is that afier
might give his country
war some
negotiation and the division of territory. If you have only won a
partial victory, you will inevitably lose in negotiation what you have
gained by war.
The solution is simple: Allow your enemies no options. Annihilate
them and their territory is yours to carve. The goal of power is to control
your enemies completely, to make them obey your will. You cannot afford
to go halfway. If they have no options, they will be forced to do your bidding. This law has applications far beyond the battlefield. Negotiation is the
insidious viper that will eat away at your victory, so give your enemies
nothing to negotiate, no hope, no room to maneuver. They are crushed
seizing his capital,

and that is that.
Realize this: In your struggle for power you will stir up rivalries and

them, deliberately or not, do not take their hatred personally. just recog»
nize that there is no possibility of peace between you, especially as long as

you stay in power. If you let them stick around, they will seek revenge, as
certainly as night follows day. To wait for them to show their cards is just

silly; as Empress Wu understood, by then it will be too late.
Be realistic: With an enemy like this around, you will never be secure.
Remember the lessons of history, and the wisdom of Moses and Mao:

Never go halfway.
It is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of banishment.

Sufficiently weakened and then exiled from your court forever, your enemies are rendered harmless. They have no hope of recovering, insinuating
themselves and hurting you. And if they cannot be banished, at least understand that they are plotting against you, and pay no heed to whatever
friendliness they feign. Your only weapon in such a situation is your own
war-iness. If you cannot banish them immediately, then
plot for the best
time to act.

LAW 15

;

113

RE VE RSAL
This law should very rarely be ignored, but it does sometimes happen that
it is better to let your enemies destroy themselves, if such a thing is possi-

ble, than to make them suffer by your hand. In warfare, for example, a
good general knows that if he attacks an army when it is cornered, its soldiers will fight much more fiercely. It is sometimes better, then, to leave
them an escape route, a way out As they retreat, they wear themselves out,
and are ultimately more demoralized by the retreat than by any defeat he
might inflict on the battlefield. When you have someone on the ropes,
then——-but only when you are sure they have no chance of recovery--you
might let them hang themselves. Let them be the agents of their own destruction. The result will be the same, and you won‘t feel half as bad.

Finally, sometimes by crushing an enemy, you embitter them so much
that they spend years and years plotting revenge. The Treaty of Versailles
had such an effect on the Germans. Some would argue that in the long run
it would be better to show some leniency. The problem is, your leniency

involves another n'sk—it may embolden the enemy, which still harbors a

grudge, but now has some room to operate. It is almost always wiser to
crush your enemy. If they plot revenge years later, do not let your guard
down, but simply crush them again.

France in the Middle Ages, going from castle to castle, reciting poetry, and

playing the perfect knight. At the castle of javiac he met and fell in love
with the beautiful lady of the house, Madame Guillelma dejaviac. He sang
her his songs, recited his poetry, played chess with her, and little by little
she in turn fell in love with him. Guillaume had a friend, Sir Pierre de Bar

jac, who traveled with him and who was also received at the castle. And
Pierre too fell in love with a lady in javiac, the gracious but temperamental
Viemetta.

Then one day Pierre and Viernetta had a violent quarrel. The lady
dismissed him, and he sought out his friend Guillaume to help heal the
breach and get him back in her good graces. Guillaume was about to leave
the castle for a while, but on his return, several weeks later, he worked his

magic, and Pierre and the lady were reconciled. Pierre felt that his love
had increased tenfold—that there was no stronger love, in fact, than the
love that follows reconciliation. The stronger and longer the disagreement,
he told Guillaume, the sweeter the feeling that comes with peace and

rapprochement,
As a troubadour, Sir Guillaume prided himself on experiencing all the

joys and sorrows of love. On hearing his friend's talk, he too wanted know
the bliss of reconciliation after a quarrel. He therefore feigned great anger
with Lady Guillelma, stopped sending her love letters. and abruptly left the
castle and stayed away, even during the festivals and hunts. This drove the
young lady wild.
Guillelma sent messengers to Guillaume to find out what bad hair»

pened, but he turned the messengers away. He thought all this would make
her angry, forcing him to plead for reconciliation as Pierre had. Instead,
however, his absence had the opposite effect: It made Guillelma love him
all the more. Now the lady pursued her knight, sending messengers and
love notes of her own. This was almost unheard of-—-a lady never pursued
her troubadour. And Guillaume did not like it. Guillelma’s forwardness
made him feel she had lost some of her dignity. Not only was he no longer

plan, he was no longer sure of his lady.
Finally, after several months of not hearing from Guillaume, Guillelma
gave up. She sent him no more messengers, and he began to wonder-perhaps she was angry? Perhaps the plan had worked after all? So much the
sure of his

better if she was. He would wait no more.-it was time to reconcile. So he

put on his best robe, decked the horse in its fanciest caparison, chose a

magnificent helmet, and rode ofi" to javiac.
On hearing that her beloved had returned, Guillelma rushed to see
him, knelt before him, dropped her veil to kiss him, and begged forgiveness for whatever slight had caused his anger. Imagine his confusion and
despairw-his plan had failed abysmally. She was not angry, she had never
been angry, she was only deeper in love, and he would never experience
the joy of reconciliation after a quarrel. Seeing her now, and still desperate

The next morning the troubadour regretted what he had done. He

made a terrible mistake. Over the next year, unable to see his lady, he ex-

herself yearning to have him back. As penance for his cruelty, she ordered
him to remove the nail from the little finger of his right hand, and to send it

Interpretation
Trying to discover the joys of reconciliation, Guillaume de Balaun inadver—
tently experienced the truth of the law of absence and presence. At the
start of an affair, you need to heighten your presence in the eyes of the
other. If you absent yourself too early, you may be forgotten. But once
your lover‘s emotions are engaged, and the feeling of love has crystallized,
absence inflames and excites. Giving no reason for your absence excites
even more:

The other person assumes he or she is at fault. While you are

away, the lover’s imagination takes flight, and a stimulated imagination
cannot help but make love grow
stronger. Conversely, the more Guillelma

pursued Guillaume, the less he loved her—she had become too present,
leaving no room for his imagination and fancy, so that his
were
feelings
suffocating. When she finally stopped sending messengers,
he was able to breathe again, and to return to his plan.
What withdraws, what becomes scarce, suddenly seems to deserve our
respect and honor. What stays too long, inundating us with its presence,
makes us disdain it. In the Middle Ages, ladies were constantly putting
their knights through trials of love, sending them on some long and arduous
quest—-all to create a pattern of absence and presence. Indeed, had
Guillaume not left his lady in the first place, she might have been forced to

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
For many centuries the Assyrians ruled upper Asia with an iron fist. In the

eighth century B.C., however, the people of Medea (now northwestern
Iran) revolted against them, and finally broke free. Now the Medes had to
establish a new government. Determined to avoid any form of despotism,
they refused to give ultimate power to any one man, or to establish a
monarchy. Without a leader, however, the country soon fell into chaos,
and fractured into small kingdoms, with village fighting against village.
In one such village lived a man named Deioces, who began to make a
name for himself for fair dealing and the ability to settle disputes.
He did this so successfully, in fact, that soon any legal conflict in the
area was brought to him, and his
power increased. Throughout the land,
the law had fallen into disrepute-——the judges were corrupt, and no one entrusted their cases to the courts any more, resorting to violence instead.
When news spread of Deioces’ wisdom, incormptibility, and unshakable
impartiality, Medean villages far and wide turned to him to settle all manner of cases.

Soon he became the sole arbiter of justice in the land.

At the height of his power, Deioces suddenly decided he had had

enough. He would no longer sit in the chair of judgment, would hear no
more suits, settle no more
disputes between brother and brother, village
and village. Complaining that he was spending so much time dealing with
other people’s problems that he had neglected his own affairs, he retired.
The country

once

again descended into chaos. With the sudden with-

drawal of a powerful arbiter like Deioces, crime increased, and contempt
for the law was never greater. The Medes held a meeting of all the villages
to decide how to get out of their

predicament. “We cannot continue to live

in this country under these conditions,” said one tribal leader. “Let us ap-

point one of our number to rule so that we can live under orderly government, rather than losing our homes altogether in the present chaos.”
And so, despite all that the Medes had suffered under the Assyrian despotism, they decided to set up a monarchy and name a king. And the man
they most wanted to rule, of course, was the fair-minded Deioces. He was
hard to convince, for he wanted nothing more to do with the villages’ infighting and bickering, but the Medes begged and pleaded—without him the
country had descended into a state of lawlessness. Deioces finally agreed.
Yet he also imposed conditions. An enormous palace was to be con-

structed for him, he was to be provided with bodyguards, and a capital city
was to

be built from which he could rule. All of this was done, and Deioces

settled into his palace. In the center of the capital, the palace was surrounded by walls, and completely inaccessible to ordinary people. Deioces
then established the terms of his rule: Admission to his presence was forbidden. Communication with the king was only possible through messengers. No one in the royal court could see him more than once a week, and
then only by permission.
Deioces ruled for fifty—three years, extended the Medean empire, and

established the foundation for what would later be the Persian empire,
under his great—great—grandson Cyrus. During Deioces’ reign, the people’s
118

LAW 16

respect for him gradually turned into a form of worship: He was not a mere
mortal, they believed, but the son of a god.

Interpretation
Deioces was a man of great ambition. He determined early on that the

country needed a strong ruler, and that he was the man for the job.
ln a land plagued with anarchy, the most powerful man is the judge

and arbiter. So Deioces began his career by making his reputation as a man
of impeccable fairness.
At the height of his power as a judge, however, Deioces realized the
truth of the law of absence and presence: By serving so many clients, he

had become too noticeable, too available, and had lost the respect he had
earlier enjoyed. People were taking his services for granted. The only way
to

regain the veneration and power he wanted was to withdraw com-

pletely, and let the Medes taste what life was like without him. As he expected, they came begging for him to rule.
Once Deioces had discovered the truth of this law, he carried it to its
ultimate realization. In the palace his people had built for him, none could
see him

except a few courtiers, and those only rarely. As Herodotus wrote,
“There was a risk that if they saw him habitually, it might lead to jealousy
and resentment, and plots would follow; but if nobody saw him, the legend
would grow that he was a being of a different order from more men.”
A man said to a Dervish.‘ “Why do I not see you mm ofim?" The Dervish

replied, “Because the words ‘Why have you not been to see me?’ are
sweeter to my ear than the words ‘Why have you come again .9’
”

KEYS TO POWER

Everything in the world depends on absence and presence. A strong presence will draw
power and attention to you—you shine more brightly than
those around you. But a point is inevitably reached where too much presence creates the
opposite effect: The more you are seen and heard from,
the more your value degrades. You become a habit. No matter how hard
you try to be different, subtly, without your knowing why. people respect
you less and less. At the right moment you must leam to withdraw yourself
before they unconsciously push you away. It is a game of hide—and~seek.
The truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of love
and seduction. In the beginning stages of an affair, the 1over‘s absence stimulates your imagination, forming a sort of aura around him or her. But this
aura fades when
you know too much--~when your imagination no longer
has room to roam. The loved one becomes a person like anyone else, a

person whose presence is taken for granted. This is why the seventeenthcentury French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos advised constant feints at with
drawal from one’s lover. “Love never dies of starvation,” she wrote, “but
often of indigestion.”
LAW 16

.

119

The moment you allow yourself to be treated like anyone else, it is too

late--you are swallowed and digested To prevent this you need to starve
the other poison of your presence. Force their respect by threatening them
with the possibility that they will lose you for good; create a pattern of presence and absence.

Once you die, everything about you will seem different. You will be
surrounded by an instant aura of respect. People will remember their criti~
cisms of you, their arguments with you, and will be filled with regret and

guilt. They are missing a presence that will never return. But you do not
have to wait until you die: By completely withdrawing for a while, you create a kind of death before death. And when you come back, it will be as if

you had come back from the dead--an air of resuirection will cling to you,
and people will be relieved at your return. This is how Deioces made him~
self king.

Napoleon was recognizing the law of absence and presence when he
said, “If I am often seen at the theater, people will cease to notice me.”
Today, in a world inundated with presence through the flood of images, the
game of withdrawal is all the more powerful. We rarely know when to
withdraw anymore, and nothing seems private, so we are awed by anyone
who is able to disappear by choice. Novelists J. D. Salinger and Thomas

Pynchon have created cultlike followings by knowing when to disappear.
Another, more everyday side of this law, but one that demonstrates
its truth even further, is the law of scarcity in the science of economics.

By withdrawing something from the market, you create instant value. In
seventeenth-century Holland, the upper classes wanted to make the tulip
more than

just a beautiful flower——they wanted it to be a kind of status sym~
bol. Making the flower scarce, indeed almost impossible to obtain, they

sparked what was later called tulipomania. A single flower was now worth
weight in gold. In our own century, similarly, the art dealer

more than its

Joseph Duveen insisted on making the paintings he sold as scarce and rare
as
possible. To keep their prices elevated and their status high, he bought up
whole collections and stored them in his basement. The paintings that he
sold became more than just paintings-—t.hey were fetish objects, their value
increased by their rarity. “You can get all the pictures you want at fifty thousand dollars apiece~—-that’s easy,” he once said. “But to get pictures at a
quarter of a million apiece—that wants doing!”

There always comes a moment when those in power overstay their
welcome. We have grown tired of them, lost respect for them; we see them
as no different from the rest of mankind, which is to say that we see them as
rather worse, since we inevitably compare their current status in our eyes
to their former one. There is an art to knowing when to retire. If it is done

right, you regain the respect you had lost, and retain a part of your power.
The greatest ruler of the sixteenth century was Charles V. King of
Spain, Hapsburg emperor, he governed an empire that at one point inclucled much of Europe and the New World. Yet at the height of his power,
in 1557, he retired to the monastery of Yuste. All of Europe was captivated
by his sudden withdrawal; people who had hated anti feared him suddenly
called him great, and he came to be seen as a saint. In more recent times,

the film actress Greta Garbo was never more admired than when she re
tired, in 1941, For some her absence came too soon—sl1e was in her midthirties—but she wisely preferred to leave on her own terms, rather than

waiting for her audience to grow tired of her.
Make yourself too available and the aura of power you have created
around yourself will wear away. Turn the game around: Make yourself less
accessible and you increase the value of your presence.

Authority:
Use absence to create

respect and esteem. If presence
diminishes fame, absence augments it.
A man who when absent is regarded as a

LAW 16

I21

REVERSAL
This law only applies once a certain level of power has been attained. The
need to withdraw only comes after you have established your presence;
leave too early and you do not increase your respect, you are simply for-

gotten. When you are first entering onto the world’: stage, create an image
that is recognizable, reproducible, and is seen everywhere. Until that status
is attained, absence is dangerous—instead of farming the flames, it will ex-

tinguish them.
In love and seduction, similarly, absence is only effective once you
have surrounded the other with your image, been seen by him or her

everywhere. Everything must remind your lover of your presence, so that
when you do choose to be away, the lover will always be thinking of you,
will always be seeing you in his or her mind’s eye.
Remember: In the beginning, make yourself not scarce but omnipresent. Only what is seen, appreciated, and loved will be missed in its
absence.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In May of 1972, chess champion Boris Spassky anxiously awaited his rival

Bobby Fischer in Reylqavik, Iceland. The two men had been scheduled to
meet for the World Championship of Chess, but Fischer had not arrived on
time and the match was on hold. Fischer had problems with the size of the
prize money, problems with the way the money was to be distributed,
problems with the logistics of holding the match in Iceland. He might back
out at any moment.

Spassky tried to be patient. His Russian bosses felt that Fischer was hu—
miliating him and told him to walk away, but Spassky wanted this match.
He knew he could destroy Fischer, and nothing was going to spoil the
greatest victory of his career. “So it seems that all our work may come to

nothing,” Spassky told a comrade. “But what can we do? It is Bobby’s
move. If he comes, we
play. If he does not come; we do not play. A man
who is willing to commit suicide has the initiative.”
Fischer finally arrived in Reykjavik, but the problems, and the threat
of cancellation, continued. He disliked the hall where the match was to be

fought, he criticized the lighting, he complained about the noise of the
cameras, he even hated the chairs in which he and Spassky were to sit
Now the Soviet Union took the initiative and threatened to withdraw their
man.

The bluff apparently worked: After all the weeks of waiting, the endless and infuriating negotiations, Fischer agreed to play. Everyone was re-

lieved, no one more than Spassky. But on the day of the ofiicial
introductions, Fischer arrived very late, and on the day when the “Match
of the Century” was to begin, he was late again. This fime, however, the
consequences would be dire: If he showed up too late he would forfeit the
first game. What was going on? Was he playing some sort of mind game?
Or was Bobby Fischer perhaps afraid of Boris Spassky? It seemed to the as-

sembled grand masters, and to Spassky, that this young kid from Brooklyn
had a terrible case of the jitters. At 5:09 Fischer showed up, exactly one
minute before the match was to be canceled.

The first game of a chess tournament is critical, since it sets the tone for
the months to come. It is often a slow and quiet struggle, with the two play-

preparing themselves for the war and trying to read each other’s strategies. This game was different. Fischer made a terrible move early on,
ers

perhaps the worst of his career, and when Spassky had him on the ropes,
he seemed to give up. Yet Spassky knew that Fischer never gave up. Even
when facing checkmate, he fought to the bitter end, wearing the opponent
down. This time, though, he seemed resigned. Then suddenly he broke out
a bold move that
put the room in a buzz. The move shocked Spassky, but
he recovered and managed to win the game. But no one could figure out
what Fischer was up to. Had he lost deliberately? Or was he rattled? Unsettled? Even, as some thought, insane?
After his defeat in the first game, Fischer complained all the more
loudly about the room, the cameras, and everything else. He also failed to

show up on time for the second game. This time the organizers had had

enough: He was given a forfeit. Now he was down two games to none, at
position from which no one had ever come back to win a chess champi-

onship. Fischer was clearly unhinged. Yet in the third game, as all those
who witnessed it remember, he had a ferocious look in his eye, a look that

clearly bothered Spassky. And despite the hole he had dug for himself, he
seemed supremely confident. He did make what appeared to be another
blunder, as he had in the first game—but his cocky air made Spassky smell
a
trap. Yet despite the Russian’s suspicions, he could not figure out the trap,
and before he knew it Fischer had checkmated him. In fact Fischer’s un—
orthodox tactics had completely unnerved his opponent. At the end of the
game, Fischer leaped up and rushed out, yelling to his confederates as he
smashed a list into his palm, “I’m crushing him with brute force!”
In the next games Fischer pulled moves that no one had seen from
him before, moves that were not his style. Now Spassky started to make
blunders. After losing the sixth game, he started to cry. One grand master

said, “After this, Spassky’s got to ask himself if it’s safe to go back to Russia." After the eighth game Spassky decided he knew what was happening:

Bobby Fischer was hypnotizing him. He decided not to look Fischer in the
eye; he lost anyway.
After the fourteenth game he called a staff conference and announced,
“An attempt is being made to control my mind.” He wondered whether the
orange juice they drank at the chess table could have been drugged.
Maybe chemicals were being blown into the air. Finally Spassky went pub—

lic, accusing the Fischer team of putting something in the chairs that was a1»
tering Spassky’s mind. The KGB went on alert: Boris Spassky was

embarrassing the Soviet Union!
The chairs were taken apart and X—rayed. A chemist found nothing

unusual in them. The only things anyone found anywhere, in fact, were
two dead flies in a lighting fixture. Spassky began to complain of hallucinations. He tried to keep playdng, but his mind was unraveling. He could not

go on. On September 2, he resigned. Although still relatively young, he
never recovered from this defeat.

Interpretation
In previous games between Fischer and Spassky, Fischer had not fared
well. Spassky had an uncanny ability to read his opponent’s strategy and
use it

against him. Adaptable and patient, he would build attacks that would

defeat not in seven moves but in seventy. He defeated Fischer every time

they played because he saw much further ahead, and because he was a brilliant psychologist who never lost control. One master said, “He doesn’t just
look for the best move. He looks for the move that will disturb the man he
is playing.”

Fischer, however, finally understood that this was one of the keys to
Spassky’s success: He played on your predictability, defeated you at your
own
game. Everything Fischer did for the championship match was an atLAW 17

125

tempt to put the initiative on his side and to keep Spassl-Ly offibalance.
Clearly the endless waiting had an effect on Spassky’s psyche. Most powerful of all, though, were Fischer’s deliberate blunders and his appearance of
having no clear strategy. In fact, he was doing everything he could to
scramble his old patterns, even if it meant losing the first match and forfeit-

ing the second.

Spassky was known for his sangfroid and levelheadedness, but for the
first time in his life he could not figure out his opponent. He slowly melted

down, until at the end he was the one who seemed insane.
Chess contains the concentrated essence of life: First, because to win
you have to be supremely patient and farseeing; and second, because the
game is built on patterns, whole sequences of moves that have been played

before and will be played again, with slight alterations, in any one match
Your opponent analyzes the patterns you are playing and uses them to try

KEYS TO POWER

Nothing is more terrifying than the sudden and unpredictable. That is why
frightened by earthquakes and tornadoes: We do not know when
they will strike. Alter one has occurred, we wait in terror for the next one.
To a lesser degree, this is the effect that unpredictable human behavior has

we are so

on us.

Animals behave in set patterns, which is why we are able to hunt and
kill them. Only man has the capacity to consciously alter his behavior, to

improvise and overcome the weight of routine and habit. Yet most men do
not realize this power. They prefer the comforts of routine, of giving in to
the animal nature that has them repeating the same compulsive actions
time and time again. They do this because it requires no effort, and because
they mistakenly believe that if they do not unsettle others, they will
be left alone. Understand: A person of power instills a kind of fear by delib-

erately unsettling those around him to keep the initiative on his side. You
sometimes need to strike without waming, to make others tremble when

they least expect it. It is a device that the powerful have used for centuries.
Filippo Maria, the last of the Visconti dukes of Milan in fifteenth»
century Italy, consciously did the opposite of what everyone expected of
him. For instance, he might suddenly shower a courtier with attention, and
then, once the man had come to expect a promotion to higher office,
I26

LAW 17

would suddenly start treating him with the utmost disdain. Confused, the
man

might leave the court, when the duke would suddenly recall him and

start treating him well again. Doubly confused, the courtier would wonder

whether his assumption that he would be promoted had become obvious,
and offensive, to the duke, and would start to behave as if he no longer expected such honor. The duke would rebuke him for his lack of ambition
and would send him away.

The secret of dealing with Filippo was simple: Do not presume to
know what he wants. Do not try to guess what will please him. Never inject
your will; just surrender to his will. Then wait to see what happens. Amidst
the confusion and uncertainty he created, the duke ruled supreme, unchal-

lenged and at peace.
Unpredictability is most often the tactic of the master, but the underdog too can use it to great effect. If you find yourself outnumbered or cornered, throw in a series of unpredictable moves. Your enemies will be so
confused that they will pull back or make a tactical blunder.
In the spring of 1862, during the American Civil War, General
Stonewall Jackson and a force of 4,600 Confederate soldiers were torment»
ing the larger Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley. Meanwhile, not far
away, General George Brinton McClellan, heading a force of 90,000
Union soldiers, was marching south from Washington, D.C., to lay siege to
Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, As the weeks of the campaign went by, Jackson repeatedly led his soldiers out of the Shenandoah
Valley, then back to it.
His movements made no sense. Was he preparing to help defend
Richmond? Was he marching on Washington, now that McClellan’s absence had left it
unprotected? Was be heading north to wreak havoc up
there? Why was his small force moving in circles?
Jacksorfs inexplicable moves made the Union generals delay the
march on Richmond as they waited to figure out what he was up to. Meanwhile, the South was able to pour reinforcements into the town. A battle
that could have crushed the Confederacy turned into a stalemate. Jackson
used this tactic time and again when facing numerically superior forces.

“Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible,” he said,
“.

.

.

such tactics will win every time and a small army may thus destroy a

large ones”
This law applies not only to war but to everyday situations. People are
always trying to read the motives behind your actions and to use your pre«
dictability against you. Throw in at completely inexplicable move and you
put them on the defensive. Because they do not understand you, they are
unnerved, and in such a state you can easily intimidate them.
Pablo Picasso once remarked, “The best calculation is the absence of
calculation. Once you have attained a certain level of recognition, others

generally figure that when you do something, it’ s for an intelligent reason.
So it’s really foolish to plot out your movements too carefully in advance.
You’re better off acting capriciously.”
For a while, Picasso worked with the ait dealer Paul Rosenberg. At first
LAW 17

127

he allowed him a fair amount of latitude in handling his paintings, then one

day, for no apparent reason, he told the man he would no longer give him
any work to sell. As Picasso explained, “Rosenberg would spend the next
forty-eight hours trying to figure out why. Was I reserving things for some
other dealer? I’d go on working and sleeping and Rosenberg would spend
his time figuring. In two days he’d come back, nerves jangled, anxious, say»
ing, ‘After all, dear friend, you wouldn’t turn me down if I offered you this
much [naming a substantially higher figure] for those paintings rather than
the price Pve been accustomed to paying you, would you?’
”

Unpredictability is not only a weapon of terror: Scrambling your patterns on a day-to-day basis will cause a stir around you and stimulate intet—
est. People will talk about you, ascribe motives and explanations that have

nothing to do with the truth, but that keep you constantly in their minds. In
the end, the more capricious you appear, the more respect you will garner.

Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner.

REVERSAL
Sometimes predictability can work in your favor: By creating a pattern for

people to be familiar and comfortable with, you can lull them to sleep.
They have prepared everything according to their preconceived notions
about you. You can use this in several ways: First, it sets up a smoke screen,
a

comfortable front behind which you can carry on deceptive actions. Sec

ond, it allows you on rare occasions to do something completely against
the pattern, unsettling your opponent so deeply he will fall to the ground
without being pushed.
In 1974 Muhammad Ali and George Foreman were scheduled to fight
for the world heavyweight boxing championship. Everyone knew what
would happen: Big George Foreman would try to land a knockout punch
while Ali would dance around him, wearing him out. That was Ali’s way of

fighting, his pattern, and he had not changed it in more than ten years. But
in this case it seemed to give Foreman the advantage: He had a devastating

punch, and if he waited, sooner or later Ali would have to come to him.
Ali, the master strategist, had other plans: In press conferences before the
big fight, he said he was going to change his style and punch it out with
Foreman. No one, least of all Foreman, believed this for a second. That

plan would be suicide on Ali’s part; he was playing the comedian, as usual.
Then, before the fight, Ali’s trainer loosened the ropes around the ring,
something a trainer would do if his boxer were intending to slug it out. But
no one believed this
play; it had to be a setup.
To everyone’s amazement, Ali did exactly what he had said he would
do. As Foreman waited for him to dance around, Ali went right up to him
and slugged it out. He completely upset his opponent’s strategy. At a loss,
Foreman ended up wearing himself out, not by chasing Ali but by throwing punches wildly, and taking more and more counterpunches. Finally,
Ali landed a dramatic right cross that knocked out Foreman. The habit of
assuming that a person’s behavior will fit its previous patterns is so strong
that not even Ali’s announcement of a strategy change was enough to upset
it. Foreman walked into a trap-«the trap he had been told to expect.
A warning: Unpredictability can work against you sometimes, es
pecially if you are in a subordinate position. There are times when it is bet
ter to let people feel comfortable and settled around you than to disturb
thern. Too much unpredictability will be seen as a sign of indecisiveness, or
even of some more serious
psychic problem. Rattems are powerful, and
can
you
terrify people by disrupting them. Such power should only be
used judiciously.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAVV
Ch’in Shih Huang Ti, the first emperor of China (221-210 B.C.), was the

mightiest man of his day. His empire was vaster and more powerful than
that of Alexander the Great. He had conquered all of the kingdoms surrounding his own kingdom of Chin and unified them into one massive
realm called China. But in the last years of his life, few, if anyone, saw him.
The emperor lived in the most magnificent palace built to that date, in
the capital of Hsien-yang. The palace had 270 pavilions; all of these were
connected by secret underground passageways, allowing the emperor to
move through the palace without anyone seeing him. He slept in a differ-—
ent room every night, and
anyone who inadvertently laid eyes on him was
a handful of men knew his whereabouts, and if
beheaded.
Only
instantly
they revealed it to anyone, they, too, were put to death.
The first emperor had grown so terrified of human Contact that when
he had to leave the palace he traveled incognito, disguising himself care

fully. On one such trip through the provinces, he suddenly died. His body
was borne back to the
capital in the emperor’s carriage, with a cart packed
with salted fish trailing behind it to cover up the smell of the rotting
one was to

know of his death. He died alone, far from his

corpse-—~no
wives, his family, his friends, and his courfiers, accompanied only by a
minister and a handful of eunuchs.

Interpretation
Shih Huang Ti started off as the king of Ch’in, a fearless warrior of unbridled ambition. Writers of the time described him as a man with “a waspish
nose, eyes like slits, the voice of a jackal, and the heart of a tiger or wolf.”

He could be merciful sometimes, but more often he “swallowed men up
without a scruple.” It was through trickery and violence that he conquered

the provinces surrounding his own and created China, forging a single nation and culture out of many. He broke up the feudal system, and to keep

eye on the many members of the royal families that were scattered
across the realm’s various kingdoms, he moved 120,000 of them to the
capan

ital, where he housed the most important couxtiers in the vast palace of

Hsienyang. He consolidated the many walls on the borders and built them
into the Great Wall of China. He standardized the country’s laws, its written language, even the size of its cartwheels.
As part of this process of unification, however, the first emperor outlawed the writings and teachings of Confucius, the philosopher whose

ideas on the moral life had already become virtually a religion in Chinese

culture. On Shih Huang Ti’s order, thousands of books relating to Confucius were burned, and anyone who quoted Confucius was to be beheaded.

This made many enemies for the emperor, and he grew constantly afraid,
even

paranoid. The executions mounted. A contemporary, the writer Han-

fei-tzu, noted that “Ch’in has been victorious for four generations, yet has
lived in constant terror and apprehension of destruction.”

isolated that barely anyone knew he had died. He had probably been poisoned by the same scheming ministers who encouraged his isolation.
That is what isolation brings: Retreat into a. fortress and you lose contact with the sources of your power. You lose your ear for what is happening around you, as well as a sense of proportion. Instead of being safer, you

At eight A.M., the king's first valet, who slept at the foot of the royal

As Saint-Simon noted, “If he turned to someone, asked him a ques-

the growing power of the throne and yearned for the days of feudalism,

The construction of Versailles, then, was far more than the decadent

keep an eye and an ear on everyone and everything around him. The

king put on his robes in the morning. There was no possibility here of pm?

KEYS TO POWER
Machiavelli makes the argument that in a strictly military sense a fortress is

invariably a mistake. It becomes a symbol of power's isolation, and is an
easy target for its builders’ enemies. Designed to defend you, fortresses ac—
tually cut you off from help and cut into your flexibility. They may appear
impregnable, but once you retire to one, everyone knows where you are;
and a siege does not have to succeed to turn your fortress into a prison.

Because humans are social creatures by nature, power depends on social interaction and circulation. To make yourself powerful you must place

yourself at the center of things, as Louis XIV did at Versailles. All activity
should revolve around you, and you should be aware of everything happening on the street, and of anyone who might be hatching plots against
you. The danger for most people comes when they feel threatened. In such
times they tend to retreat and close ranks, to find security in a kind of
fortress. In doing so, however, they come to rely for information on a
smaller and smaller circle, and lose perspective on events around them.

They lose maneuverability and become easy targets, and their isolation
makes them paranoid. As in warfare and most games of strategy, isolation
often precedes defeat and death.
In moments of uncertainty and danger, you need to fight this desire to
turn inward. Instead, make yourself more accessible, seek out old allies and
make new ones, force yourself into more and more different circles. This
has been the trick of powerful people for centuries.
The Roman statesman Cicero was born into the lower nobility, and
had little chance of power unless he managed to make a place for himself
among the aristocrats who controlled the city. He succeeded brilliantly,
identifying everyone with influence and figuring out how they were connected to one another. He mingled everywhere, knew everyone, and had
such a vast network of connections that an enemy here could easily be
counterbalanced by an ally there,
The French statesman Talleyrand played the game the same way. Although he came from one of the oldest aristocratic families in France, he
made a point of always staying in touch with what was happening in the
streets of Paris, allowing him to foresee trends and troubles. He even got a
certain pleasure out of mingling with shady criminal types, who supplied
him with valuable information. Every time there was a crisis, a transition of
power--the end of the Directory, the fall of Napoleon, the abdication of
Louis XVIII-~he was able to survive and even thrive, because he never
closed himself up in a small circle but always forged connections with the
new order.

This law pertains to kings and queens, and to those of the highest
power: The moment you lose contact with your people, seeking security in
isolation, rebellion is brewing. Never imagine yourself so elevated that you
can

afford to cut yourself off from even the lowest echelons. By retreating

to a fortress, you make

yourself an easy target for your plotting subjects,
who view your isolation as an insult and a reason for rebellion.
Since humans are such social creatures, it follows that the social arts
that make us pleasant to be around can be practiced only by constant exposure and circulation. The more you are in contact with others, the more
graceful and at ease you become. Isolation, on the other hand, engenders
an awkwardness in

your gestures, and leads to further isolation, as people

In 1545 Duke Cosimo I de’ Medici decided that to ensure the immor-

tality of his name he would commission frescoes for the main chapel of the
church of San Lorenzo in Florence. He had many great painters to choose
from, and in the end he picked jacopo da Pontonno. Getting on in years,
Pontormo wanted to make these frescoes his chef d’oeuvre and legacy. His
first decision was to close the chapel off with walls, partitions, and blinds.
He wanted no one to witness the creation of his masterpiece, or to steal his
ideas. He would outdo Michelangelo himself. When some young men

broke into the chapel out of curiosity, jacopo sealed it off even further.
Pontormo filled the chape1’s ceiling with biblical scenes—the Creation,

Adam and Eve, Noah's ark, on and on. At the top of the middle will he

painted Christ in his majesty, raising the dead onjudgment Day. The artist
worked on the chapel for eleven years, rarely leaving it, since he had de—
veloped a phobia for human contact and was afraid his ideas would be
stolen.
Ponrormo died before completing the frescoes, and none of them has
survived. But the great Renaissance writer Vasari, a friend of Pontormds
who saw the frescoes shortly after the artist’s death, left a description of

what they looked like. There

was

a

total lack of proportion. Scenes

bumped against scenes, figures in one story being juxtaposed with those in
another, in maddening numbers. Pontormo had become obsessed with de»
tall but had lost any sense of the overall composition. Vasari left off his de~

scription of the frescoes by writing that if he continued, “I think I would go
mad and become entangled in this painting, just as I believe that in the
eleven years of time jacopo spent on it, he entangled himself and anyone
else who saw it.” Instead of crowning Pontormo’s career, the work became
his undoing.
These frescoes were visual equivalents of the effects of isolation on the

human mind: a loss of proportion, an obsession with detail combined with
an inability to see the
larger picture, a kind of extravagant ugliness that no

longer communicates. Clearly, isolation is as deadly for the creative arts as
for the social arts. Shakespeare is the most famous writer in history because, as a dramatist for the popular stage, he opened himself up to the
masses, making his work accessible to people no matter what their education and taste. Artists who hole themselves up in their fortress lose a sense

of proportion, their work communicating only to their small circle. Such
art remains cornered and

powerless.

Finally, since power is a human creation, it is inevitably increased by
Contact with other people. Instead of falling into the fortress mentality,
view the world in the following manner: It is like a vast Versailles, with

every room communicating with another. You need to be permeable, able
to float in and out of different circles and mix with different types. That
kind of mobility and social contact will protect you from plotters, who will
be unable to keep secrets from you, and from your enemies, who will be
unable to isolate you from your allies. Always on the move, you mix and

mingle in the rooms of the palace, never sitting or settling in one place. No
hunter can fix his aim on such a svvifbmoving creature.

tate is thought. The weight of society's pressure to conform, and the lack of

distance from other people, can make it impossible to think clearly about
what is going on around you. As a temporary recourse, then, isolation can

help you to gain perspective. Many a serious thinker has been produced in
prisons, where we have nothing to do but think. Machiavelli could write
The Prince only once he found himself in exile and isolated on a farm far
from the political intrigues of Florence.
The danger is, however, that this kind of isolation will sire all kinds of
strange and perverted ideas. You may gain perspective on the larger picture, but you lose a sense of your own smallness and limitations. Also, the
more isolated you are, the harder it is to break out of your isolation when
you choose to——it sinks you deep into its quicksand without your noticing.
If you need time to think, then, choose isolation only as a last resort, and

only in small doses. Be careful to keep your way back into society open.

In the early part of the thirteenth century, Muhammad, the shah of
Khwarezm, managed after many wars to forge a huge empire, extending
west to present-day Turkey and south to Afghanistan. The empire’s center
was the great Asian
capital of Samarkand. The shah had a powerful, welltrained army, and could mobilize 200,000 waniors within days.
In 1219 Muhammad received an embassy from a new tribal leader to
the east, Genghis Khan. The embassy included all sorts of gifts to the great
Muhammad, representing the finest goods from Khan’s small but growing
Mongol empire. Genghis Khan wanted to reopen the Silk Route to Europe,

In the late 1910s some of the best swindlers in America formed a con-artist

ring based in Denver, Colorado. In the winter months they would spread
across the southern

states, plying their trade. In 1920 Joe Furey, a leader of

the ring, was working his way through Texas, making hundreds of thou-

After five years of hunting, Norfleet had single-handedly destroyed the

country’s largest confederation of con artists. The efiort bankrupted him
and mined his marriage, but he died a satisfied man.
Interpretation
Most men accept the humiliation of being conned with a sense of resignation. They learn their lesson, recognizing that there is no such thing as a
free lunch, and that they have usually been brought down by their own
greed for easy money. Some, however, refuse to take their medicine. In
stead of reflecting on their own gullibility and avarice, they see themselves
as totally innocent victims.
Men like this may seem to be crusaders for justice and honesty, but
they are actually immoderately insecure. Being fooled, being conned, has
activated their self-doubt, and they are desperate to repair the damage.
Were the mortgage on N0rfleet’s ranch, the collapse of his marriage, and
the years of borrowing money and living in cheap hotels worth his revenge
over his embarrassment at
being fleeced? To the Norfleets of the world,
overcoming their embarrassment is worth any price.
All people have insecurities, and often the best way to deceive a sucker
is to play upon his insecurities. But in the realm of power, everything is a

question of degree, and the person who is decidedly more insecure than
the average mortal presents great dangers. Be warned: If you practice de~
ception or trickery of any sort, study your mark well. Some people’s insecurity and ego fragility cannot tolerate the slightest offense. To see if you
are
dealing with such a type, test them first—make, say, a mild joke at their
expense. A confident person will laugh; an overly insecure one will react as
if personally insulted. If you suspect you are dealing with this type, find another victim.

Transgression III
In the fifth century B.C., Ch’ung-erh, the prince of Ch’in (in present-day

China), had been forced into exile. He lived modestly——even, sometimes,
in poverty—waiting for the time when he could return home and resume

his princely life. Once he was passing through the state of Cheng, where

the ruler, not knowing who he was, treated him rudely. The r1.1ler’s minister, Shu Chan, saw this and said, “This man is a worthy prince. May Your
Highness treat him with great courtesy and thereby place him under an

obligation!” But the ruler, able to see only the prince’s lowly station, ignored this advice and insulted the prince again. Shu Chan again warned

his master, saying, “If Your Highness cannot treat Ch’ung~erh with cour-

tesy, you should put him to death, to avoid calamity in the future.” The
ruler only scoffed.
Years later, the prince was finally able to return home, his circumstances

greatly changed. He did not forget who had been kind to him, and

who had been insolent, during his years of poverty. Least of all did he for»

get his treatment at the hands of the ruler of Cheng. At his first opportunity
he assembled a vast army and marched on Chang, taking eight cities, de~

straying the kingdom, and sending the ruler into an exile of his own.
Interpretation
You can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of little importance and means today can be a person of power tomorrow. We forget
a lot in our

lives, but we rarely forget an insult.

How was the ruler of Cheng to know that Prince Ch’ung-erh was an

ambitious, calculating, cunning type, a serpent with along memory? There
was
really no way for him to know, you may say-—but since there was no
way, it would have been better not to tempt the fates by finding out. There

Transgresskm IV
The year of 1920 had been a particularly bad one for American art dealers.

Big buyers«-«the robber-baron generation of the previous century-~were
getting to an age where they were dying off like flies, and no new million»
aires had emerged to take their place. Things were so bad that a number of
the major dealers decided to pool their resources, an unheard-of event,
since art dealers usually get along like cats and dogs.
Joseph Duveen, art dealer to the richest tycoons of America, was suffering more than the others that year, so he decided to go along with this
alliance. The group now consisted of the five biggest dealers in the country.
Looking around for a new client, they decided that their last best hope was
Henry Ford, then the wealthiest man in America. Ford had yet to venture
into the art market, and he was such a big target that it made sense for them
to work

together.

The dealers decided to assemble a list, “The 100 Greatest Paintings in
the World” (all of which they happened to have in stock), and to offer the
lot of them to Ford. With one purchase he could make himself the world’s

greatest collector. The consortium worked for weeks to produce a magnificent object: a three-volume set of books containing beautiful reproductions
of the paintings, as well as scholarly texts accompanying each picture. Next

they made a personal visit to Ford at his home in Dearborn, Michigan.
There they were surprised by the simplicity of his house: Mr. Ford was ob‘

viously an extremely unaffected man.
Ford received them in his study. Looking through the book, he expressed astonishment and delight. The excited dealers began imagining the
millions of dollars that would shortly flow into their coflers. Finally, how—
ever, Ford looked up from the book and said, “Gentlemen, beautiful books

like these, with beautiful colored pictures like these, must cost an awful
lot!” “But Mr. Ford!” exclaimed Duveen, “we don’t expect you to buy these

142

j

LAW 19

books. We got them up especially for you, to show you the pictures. These
books are a present to you.” Ford seemed puzzled. “Gentlemen,” he said,
“it is extremely nice of you, but I really don’t see how I can accept a beau-

tiful, expensive present like this from strangers.” Duveen explained to Ford
that the reproductions in the books showed paintings they had hoped to
sell to him. Ford finally understood. “But gentlemen,” he exclaimed, “what
would I want with the original pictures when the ones right here in these

books are so beautiful?”

Interpretation
Joseph Duveen prided himself on studying his victims and clients in ad
Vance, figuring out their weaknesses and the peculiarities of their tastes be
fore he ever met them. He was driven by desperation to drop this tactic just
once, in his assault on Henry Ford. It took him months to recover from his
misjudgrnent, both mentally and monetarily. Ford was the unassuming
plain—ma.n type who just isn’t worth the bother. He was the incarnation of
those literal-minded folk who do not possess enough imagination to be de
ceived. From then on, Duveen saved his energies for the Mellons and Mor-

gans of the world——men crafty enough for him to entrap in his snares.

KEYS T() POWER
The ability to measure people and to know who you’re dealing with is the
most important skill of all in

gathering and conserving power. Without it

you are blind: Not only will you offend the wrong people, you will choose
the Wrong types to work on, and will think you are flattering people when
you are actually insulting them. Before embarking on any move, take the
of your mark or potential opponent. Otherwise you will waste

measure

time and make mistakes.

Study people's weaknesses, the chinks in their

armor, their areas of both pride and insecurity. Know their ins and outs be-

fore you even decide whether or not to deal with them.
Two final words of caution: First, in judging and measuring your oppo~
nent, never rely on your instincts. You will make the greatest mistakes of all
if you rely on such inexact indicators. Nothing can substitute for gathering

knowledge. Study and spy on your opponent for however long it
this
will pay off in the long run.

Second, never trust appearances. Anyone with a serpent’s heart can
use a show of kindness to cloak

it; a person who is blustery on the outside is
often really a coward. Learn to see through appearances and their contradictions. Never trust the version that people give of themselves——it is ut-

terly unreliable.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
When Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne of England, in 1558, there
was much to-do about her

finding a husband. The issue was debated in Par-

liament, and was a. main topic of conversation among Englishmen of all
classes; they often disagreed as to whom she should marry, but everyone

thought she should marry as soon as possible, for a queen must have a
king, and must bear heirs for the kingdom. The debates raged on for years.
Meanwhile the most handsome and eligible bachelors in the realm-Sir
Robert Dudley, the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter Ra.leigh———vied for Elizabetlfs
hand. She did not discourage them, but she seemed to be in no hurry, and
her hints as to which man might be her favorite often contradicted each
other. In 1566, Parliament sent a delegation to Elizabeth urging her to
marry before she was too old to bear children. She did not argue, nor did
she discourage the delegation, but she remained a virgin nonetheless.
The delicate game that Elizabeth played with her suitors slowly made
the
her
subject of innumerable sexual fantasies and the object of cultish

worship. The court physician, Simon Forman, used his diary to describe
his dreams of deflowering her. Painters represented her as Diana and other
goddesses. The poet Edmund Spenser and others wrote eulogies to the Virgin Queen. She was referred to as “tha, wor1d’s Empresse,” “that virtuous
Virgo” who rules the world and sets the stars in motion. In conversation
with her, her many male suitors would employ bold sexual innuendo, a
dare that Elizabeth did not discourage. She did all she could to stir their in
terest and simultaneously keep them at bay.
Throughout Europe, kings and princes knew that a marriage with Elizabeth would seal an alliance between England and any nation. The king of
Spain wooed her, as did the prince of Sweden and the archduke of Austria.
She politely refused them all.
The great diplomatic issue of Elizabetlfs day was posed by the revolt
of the Flemish and Dutch Lowlands, which were then possessions of Spain.
Should England break its alliance with Spain and choose France as its main
ally on the Continent, thereby encouraging Flemish and Dutch independence? By 1570 it had come to seem that an alliance with France would be
England’s wisest course. France had two eligible men of noble blood, the
dukes of Anjou and Alencon, brothers of the French king. Would either of
them marry Elizabeth? Both had advantages, and Elizabeth kept the hopes
of both alive. The issue simmered for years. The duke of Anjou made sevM6

a

treaty was signed that sealed peace between

England. By 1582 Elizabeth felt she could break off the

courtship. In the case of the duke of Anjou in particular, she did so with
great relief: For the sake of diplomacy she had allowed herself to be
courted by a man whose presence she could not stand and whom she
found physically repulsive. Once peace between France and England was
secure, she

dropped the unctuous duke as politely as she could.

By this time Elizabeth was too old to bear children. She was accordingly able to live the rest of her life as she desired, and she died the Virgin
Queen. She left no direct heir, but ruled through a period of incomparable
peace and cultural fertility.
“

Interpretation
Elizabeth had good reason not to marry: She had witnessed the mistakes of

Mary Queen of Scots, her cousin. Resisting the idea of being ruled by a
woman, the Scots expected Mary to many and marry wisely. To wed a foreigner would be unpopular; to favor any particular noble house would
open up terrible rivalries. In the end Mary chose Lord Damley, a Catholic.
In doing so she incurred the wrath of Scotland’s Protestants, and endless
turmoil ensued.

Elizabeth knew that marriage can often lead to a female ru1er’s undo-

ing: By marrying and committing to an alliance with one party or nation,
the queen becomes embroiled in conflicts that are not of her choosing, con~
flicts which may eventually overwhelm her or lead her into a futile war.

Also, the husband becomes the de facto ruler, and often tries to do away
with his wife the queen, as Darnley tried to get rid of Mary. Elizabeth
learned the lesson well. She had two goals as a ruler: to a‘ ‘old marriage and
to avoid war. She managed to combine these goals

by Lnngling the possi-

bility of marriage in order to forge alliances. The moment she committed
to any single suitor would have been the moment she lost her power. She
had to emanate mystery and

desirability, never discouraging anyone’s

hopes but never yielding.
Through this lifelong game of flirting and withdrawing, Elizabeth
dominated the country and every man who sought to conquer her. As the
center of attention, she was in control. Keeping her independence above
all, Elizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of worship.
I would rather be a beggar and single than a queen and married.

KEYS 'l‘(..) POWER

Since power depends greatly on appearances, you must learn the tricks
that will enhance your image. Refusing to commit to a person or group is
one of these, When you

hold yourself back, you incur not anger but a kind
LAW 20

§

of respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make yourself un-

graspable, rather than succumbing to the group, or to the relationship, as
most people do. This aura of power
only grows with time: As your reputation for independence grows, more and more people will come to desire
you, wanting to be the one who gets you to commit. Desire is like a virus: If
we see that someone is desired
by other people, we tend to find this person
desirable too.

The moment you commit, the magic is gone. You become like everyone

else. People will try all kinds of underhanded methods to get you to

commit. They will give you gifts, shower you with favors, all to put you

under obligation. Encourage the attention, stimulate their interest, but do
not commit at any cost. Accept the gifts and favors if you so desire, but be

careful to maintain your inner aloofness, You cannot inadvertently allow

yourself to feel obligated to anyone.
Remember, though: The goal is not to put people off, or to make it seem
that you are incapable of commitment. Like the Virgin Queen, you need to
stir the pot, excite interest, lure people with the possibility of having you.
You have to bend to their attention occasionally, then——but never too far:
The Greek soldier and statesman Alcibiades played this game to perfection. It was Alcibiades who inspired and led the massive Athenian atmada that invaded Sicily in 414 BC. When envious Athenians back home
tried to bring him down by accusing him of trumpedup charges, he defected to the enemy, the Spartans, instead of facing a trial back home. Then,
after the Athenians were defeated at Syracuse, he left Sparta for Persia, even
though the power of Sparta was now on the rise. Now, however, both the
Athenians and the Spartans courted Alcibiades because of his influence
with the Persians; and the Pen tans showered him with honors because of
his power over the Athenians and the Spartans. He made promises to every
side but committed to none, and in the end he held all the cards.
If you aspire to power and influence, try the Alcibiades tactic: Put

yourself in the middle between competing powers. Lure one side with the
promise of your help; the other side, always wanting to outdo its enemy,
will pursue you as well. As each side vies for your attention, you will im-

mediately seem a person of great influence and desirability. More power
will accrue to you than if you had rashly committed to one side. To perfect
this tactic you need to keep yourself inwardly free from emotional entanglements, and to view all those around you as pawns in your rise to the top.
You cannot let yourself become the lackey for any cause.
In the midst of the 1968 U.S. presidential election, Henry Kissinger
made a phone call to Richard Nixon’s team. Kissinger had been allied with
Nelson Rockefeller, who had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination. Now Kissinger offered to supply the Nixon camp with valuable inside
information on the negotiations for peace in Vietnam that were then going
on in Paris.

He had a man on the negotiating team keeping him informed of

the latest developments. The Nixon team gladly accepted his offer.
At the same time, however, Kissinger also approached the Democratic

nominee, Hubert Humphrey, and offered his aid. The Humphrey people
148

LAW 20

asked him for inside information on Nixon and he supplied it. “Look,”

Kissinger told Hurnphrey’s people, “I’ve hated Nixon for years.” In fact he
had no interest in either side. What he really wanted was what he got: the

promise of a high-level cabinet post from both Nixon and Humphrey.
Whichever man won the election, Kissingefs career was secure.
The winner, of course, was Nixon, and Kissinger duly went on to his
cabinet post. Even so, he was careful never to appear too much of a Nixon
man.

When Nixon was reelected in 1972, men much more loyal to him

than Kissinger were fired. Kissinger was also the only Nixon high official to
survive Watergate and serve under the next president, Gerald Ford. By

maintaining a little distance he thrived in turbulent times.
Those who use this strategy often notice a strange phenomenon:
People who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in the
process, for their help is so easily obtained, while those who stand back
find themselves besieged with supplicants. Their aloofness is powerful, and
everyone wants them on their side.
When Picasso, after early years of poverty, had become the most suc-

cessful aitist in the world, he did not commit himself to this dealer or that

dealer, although they now besieged him from all sides with attractive offers
and grand promises. Instead, he appeared to have no interest in their services; this technique drove them wild, and as they fought over him his
prices only rose. When Henry Kissinger, as U.S. secretary of state, wanted
to reach détente with the Soviet Union, he made no concessions or conciliatory gestures, but courted China instead. This infuriated and also scared
the Soviets——-they were already politically isolated and feared further isola
tion if the United States and China, ,ca.me together. Kissinger’s move
pushed them to the negotiating table. The tactic has a parallel in seduction:

When you want to seduce a woman, Stendhal advises, court her sister first.

Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a challenge for
them to win your affections. As long as you imitate the wise Virgin Queen
and stimulate their hopes, you will remain a magnet of attention and desire.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the late fifteenth century, the strongest city~states in Italy-——Venice, Florence, Rome, and Milan~—-found themselves constantly squabbling. Hover-

ing above their struggles were the nations of France and Spain, ready to

grab whatever they could from the weakened Italian powers. And trapped
in the middle was the small state of Mantua, ruled by the young Duke
Gianfrancesco Gonzaga. Mantua was strategically located in northern
Italy, and it seemed only a matter of time before one of the powers swallowed it up and it ceased to exist as an independent kingdom.
Gonzaga was a fierce warrior and a skilled commander of troops, and
he became a kind of mercenzuy general for whatever side paid him best. In
the year 1490, he married Isabella d’Este, daughter of the ruler of another
small Italian duchy, Ferrara. Since he now spent most of his time away
iron Mantua, it fell to Isabella to rule in his stead.
lsabellzfs first true test as ruler came in 1498, when King Louis XII of
France was preparing armies to attack Milan. In their usual perfidious fash«

ion, the Italian states immediately looked for ways to profit from Mila.n’s
difficulties. Pope Alexander VI promised not to intervene, thereby giving
the French carte blanche. The Venefians signaled that they would not help
Milan, either—and in exchange for this, they hoped the French would give
them Mantua. The ruler of Milan, Lodovico Sforza, suddenly found himself alone and abandoned. He turned to Isabella d’Este, one of his closest
friends (also rumored to be his lover), and begged her to persuade Duke
Gonzaga to come to his aid. Isabella tried, but her husband balked, for he
saw Sforza’s cause as
hopeless. And so, in 1499, Louis swooped down on
Milan and took it with ease.

Isabella now faced a dilemma: If she stayed loyal to Lodovico, the
French would now move against her. But if, instead, she allied herself with

France, she would make enemies elsewhere in Italy, compromising Mantua once Louis

eventually withdrew. And if she looked to Venice or Rome

for help, they would simply swallow up Mantua under the cloak of coming
to her aid. Yet she had to do

something. The mighty king of France was

breathing down her neck: She decided to befxiend him, as she had be~
friended Lodovico Sforza before him——-with alluring gifts, witty, intelligent
letters, and the possibility of her company, for Isabella was famous as a
woman of

incomparable beauty and charm.

In 1500 Louis invited Isabella to a great party in Milan to celebrate his

victory. Leonardo da Vinci built an enormous mechanical lion for the affair: When the lion opened its mouth, it spewed fresh lilies, the symbols of
French royalty. At the party Isabella wore one of her celebrated dresses

(she had by far the largest wardrobe of any of the Italian princesses), and
just as she had hoped, she charmed and captivated Louis, who ignored all
the other ladies vying for his attention. She soon became his constant companion, and in exchange for her friendship he pledged to protect Mantua’s

independence from Venice.
As one danger receded, however, another, more worrying one arose,
this time from the south, in the form of Cesare Borgia Starting in 1500,
Borgia had marched steadily northward, gobbling up all the small kingdoms in his path in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. Isabella under»
stood Cesare perfectly: He could be neither tnisted 1101' in any way
offended. He had to be cajoled and kept at arm’s length. Isabella began by
sending him gifts——falcons, prize dogs, perfumes, and dozens of masks,
which she knew he always wore when he walked the streets of Rome. She
sent messengers with flattering greetings (although these messengers also
acted as her spies). At one point Cesare asked if he could house some
troops in Mantua; Isabella managed to dissuade him politely, knowing full
well that once the troops were quartered in the city, they would never
leave.
Even while Isabella was charming Cesare, she convinced everyone

When Isabella had a child, she asked Cesare to be the godfather. She even

dangled in front of him the possibility of a marriage between her family
and his. Somehow it all worked, for although elsewhere he seized everything in his path, he spared Mantua.
In 1503 Cesare’s father, Alexander, died, and a few years later the new
pope, Julius II, went to war to drive the French troops from Italy. When
the ruler of Fe1rara——Alfonso, Isabella’s brother—sided with the French,

Julius decided to attack and humble him. Once again Isabella found herself
in the middle: the pope on one side, the French and her brother on the

other. She dared not ally herself with either, but to offend either would be

equally disastrous. Again she played the double game at which she had become so
expert. On the one hand she got her husband Gonzaga to fight for
the pope, knowing he would not fight very hard. On the other she let
French troops pass through Mantua to come to Ferrara’s aid. While she
publicly complained that the French had “invaded” her territory, she privately supplied them with valuable information. To make the invasion
plausible to Julius, she even had the French pretend to plunder Mantua. It
worked once again: The pope left Mantua alone.
In 1513, after a lengthy siege, Julius defeated Ferrara, and the French

troops withdrew. Worn out by the effort, the pope died a few months later.
With his death, the nightmarish cycle of battles and petty squabbles began
to repeat itself.

Interpretation
Isabella d’Este understood Italy’s political situation with amazing clarity:
Once you took the side of any of the forces in the field, you were doomed.
The powerful would take you over, the weak would wear you down. Any
new alliance would lead to a new

enemy, and as this cycle stirred up more

conflict, other forces would be dragged in, until you could no longer extricate yourself. Eventually you would collapse from exhaustion.

Isabella steered her kingdom on the only course that would bring her

safely through. She would not allow herself to lose her head through loy~
alty to a duke or a king. Nor would she try to stop the conflict that raged
around her---that would only drag her into it. And in any case the conflict
was to her
advantage. If die various parties were fighting to the death, and
exhausting themselves in the process, they were in no position to gobble
up Mantua. The source of Isabella’s power was her clever ability to seem
interested in the affairs and interests of each side, while actually commib
ting to no one but herself and her kingdom.
Once you step into a. fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all
initiative. The combatants’ interests become your interests; you become

their tool. Learn to control yourself, to restrain your natural tendency to
take sides and join the fight. Be friendly and charming to each of the com~

batants, then step back as they collide. V/Wth every battle they grow weaker,
while you grow stronger with every battle you avoid.

KEYS TO POWER

To succeed in the game of power, you have to master your emotions. But
even if you succeed in

gaining such self-control, you can never control the

temperamental dispositions of those around you. And this presents a great
danger. Most people operate in a whirlpool of emotions, constantly react‘
ing, churning up squabbles and conflicts. Your sell’—contIol and autonomy
will only bother and infuriate them. They will my to draw you into the
whirlpool, begging you to take sides in their endless battles, or to make
peace for them. If you succumb to their emotional entreaties, little by little
you will find your mind and time occupied by their problems. Do not allow

whatever compassion and pity you possess to suck you in. You can never
win in this game; the conflicts can only multiply.

On the other hand, you cannot completely stand aside, for that would

needless offense. To play the game properly, you must seem interested in other people‘s problems, even sometimes appear to take their side.
cause

But while you make outward gestures of support, you must maintain your
inner energy and sanity by keeping your emotions disengaged. No matter

how hard people try to pull you in, never let your interest in their affairs
and petty squabbles go beyond the surface. Give them gifts, listen with a

sympathetic look, even occasionally play the charmer-—but inwardly keep
both the friendly kings and the perfidious Borgias at arm’s length. By refus~
ing to commit and thus maintaining your autonomy you retain the initiative: Your

choosing, not defensive

Slowness to pick up your weapons can be a weapon itself, especially if
you let other people exhaust themselves fighting, then take advantage of
their exhaustion. In ancient China, the kingdom of Chin once invaded the

kingdom of Hsing. Huan, the ruler of a nearby province, thought he
should rush to Hsing’s defense, but his adviser counseled him to wait:
“Hsing is not yet going to ruin,” he said, “and Chin is not yet exhausted. If
Chin is not exhausted, [we] cannot become very influential. Moreover, the
merit of supporting a state in danger is not as great as the virtue of reviving
a ruined one.” The adviser’s
argument won the day, and as he had predicted, Huan later had the glory both of rescuing Hsing from the brink of
destruction and then of conquering an exhausted Chin. He stayed out of
the fighting until the forces engaged in it had worn each other down, at
which point it was safe for him to intervene.
That is what holding back from the fray allows you: time to position

yourselfto take advantage of the situation once one side starts to lose. You
take the game a step further, by promising your support to both

sides in a conflict while maneuvering so that the one to come out ahead in
the struggle is you. This was whatCastn1ccio Castracani, ruler of the Italian
town of Lucca in the fourteenth century, did when he had

designs on the

town of Pistoia. A siege would have been expensive, costing both lives and

money, but Castruccio knew that Pistoia contained two rival factions, the
Blacks and the Whites, which hated one another. He negotiated with the

Blacks, promising to help them against the Whites; then, without their
knowledge, he promised the Whites he would help them against the
Blacks. And Castruccio kept his promiseswhe sent an army to a Black-

controlled gate to the city, which the sentxies of course welcomed in.
Meanwhile another of his armies entered through a White—control1ed gate.
The two armies united in the middle, occupied the town, killed the leaders
of both factions, ended the internal war, and took Pistoia for Castruccio.

Preserving your autonomy gives you options when people come to
blows—~you can play the mediator, broker the peace, while really securing
your own interests. You can pledge support to one side and the other may
have to court you with a higher bid. Or, like Castruccio, you can appear to
take both sides, then play the antagonists against each other.

Hence. This is risky business. First, it is often difficult to foresee which side
will prevail in the long run. But even if you guess right and ally yourself
with the stronger party, you may find yourself swallowed up and lost, or

conveniently forgotten, when they become victors. Side with the weaker,
on the other hand, and
you are doomed. But play a waiting game and you
cannot lose.

In Frances July Revolution of 1830, after three days of riots, the statesman

Talleyrand, now elderly, sat by his Paris window, listening to the peel-

ing bells that signaled the riots were over. Turning to an assistant, he said,
“Ah, the bells! We’re winning.” “Who’s ‘we,’ man puma?” the assistant
asked. Gesturing for the man to keep quiet, Talleyrand replied, “Not a
word! I’ll tell you who we are tomorrow.” He well knew that only fools
rush into a situalion—tl1a.t by committing too quickly you lose your ma~

neuverability. People also respect you less: Perhaps tomorrow, they think,
you will commit to another, dilferent cause, since you gave yourself so eas
ily to this one. Good fortune is a fickle god and will often pass from one
side to the other. Commitment to one side deprives you of the advantage of
time and the luxury of waiting. Let others fall in love with this group or
that; for your part don’t rush in, don’t lose your head.

Finally, there are occasions when it is wisest to drop all pretence of appearing supportive and instead to trumpet your independence and self»
reliance. The aristocratic pose of independence is particularly important
for those who need to gain respect. George Washington recognized this in
his work to establish the young American republic on firm ground As
president, Washington avoided the temptation of making an alliance with
France or England, despite the pressure on him to do so. He wanted the
country to earn the world’s respect through its independence. Although a
treaty with France mighthave helped in the short toxin, in the long run he
knew it would be more effective to establish the nation’s autonomy. Eu-

rope would have to see the United States as an equal power.
Remember: You have only so much energy and so much time. Every
moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your

strength. You

may be afraid that people will condemn you as heartless, but in the end,

maintaining your independence and selfvreliance will gain you more re
spect and place you in a position of power from which you can choose to

help others on your own initiative.

REVERSAL

Both parts of this law will turn against you if you take it too far. The game

proposed here is delicate and difficult. If you play too many parties against
one another,
they will see through the maneuver and will gang up on you.
If you keep your growing number of suitors waiting too long, you will inspire not desire but distrust. People will start to lose interest. Eventually
you may find it worthwhile to commit to one sidevwif only for appearances’
sake, to prove you are capable of attachment.
Even then, however, the key will be to maintain your inner independence-—to keep yourself from getting emotionally involved. Preserve the
unspoken option of being able to leave at any moment and reclaim your
freedom if the side you are allied with starts to collapse. The friends you
made while you were being courted will give you plenty of places to go
once you jump ship.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the winter of 1872, the U.S. financier Asbury Harpending; was visiting
London when he received a cable: A diamond mine had been discovered
in the American West. The cable came from a reliable source—-William

Ralston, owner of the Bank of Califomia—-but Harpending nevertheless
took it as a practical joke, probably inspired by the recent discovery of

huge diamond mines in South Africa. True, when reports had first come in
of gold being discovered in the western United States, everyone had been
skeptical, and those had turned out to be true. But a diamond mine in the
West‘ Haipending showed the cable to his fellow financier Baron Roth
schild (one of the richest men in the world), saying it must be a joke. The
baron, however, replied, “Don’t be too sure about that. America is a very
large country. It has furnished the world with many surprises already. Perhaps it has others in store.” Harpending promptly took the first ship back
to the States.

When Harpending reached San Francisco, there was an excitement in

amond mine. They had not divulged its location, in Wyoming, but had led

aliighly respected mining expert to it several weeks back, taking a circular
route so he could not guess his whereabouts. Once there, the expert had

watched as the miners dug up diamonds. Back in San Francisco the expert
had taken the gems to various jewelers, one of whom had estimated their
worth at $15 million.

Ha:-pending and Ralston now asked Amold and Slack to accompany
them back to New York, where the jeweler Charles Tiffany would verify
the original estimates. The prospectors responded uneasily--they smelled

trap: How could they must these city slickers? Vifhat if Tiffany and the financiers managed to steal the whole mine out from under them? Ralston
tried to allay their fears by giving them $100,000 and placing another
$300,000 in escrow for them. If the deal went through, they would be paid
a

an additional

$300,000. The miners agreed.

The little group traveled to New York, where a meeting was held at the
mansion of Samuel L. Barlow. The cream of the city’s aristocracy was in at-

tx-,ndance——General George Brinton McClellan, commander of the Union
forces in the Civil War; General Benjamin Butler; Horace Greeley, editor
of the newspaper the New Ybrk Tribune; Harpending; Ralston; and Tiffany.

Only Slack and Arnold were missing—-as tourists in the city, they had decided to go sight-seeing.
When Tiffany announced that the gems were real and worth a. fortune,
the financiers could barely control their excitement. They wired Roth_,

schild and other tycoons to tell them about the diamond mine and inviting
them to share in the investment. At the same time, they also told the

prospectors that they wanted one more test: They insisted that a mining exI pert of their choosing accompany Slack and Arnold to the site to verify its
wealth. The prospectors reluctantly agreed. In the meantime, they said,

they had to return to San Francisco. The jewels that Tiffany had examined
they left with Harpending for safekeeping.

in the country, met the
prospectors in San Francisco. _]ani.n was a born

Accompanying janin were Harpending, and several other interested fi~
nanciers. As with the previous expert, the prospectors led the team through
a
complex series of canyons, completely confusing them as to their where
abouts. Arriving at the site, the financiers watched in amazement as janin
dug the area up, leveling anthills, turning over boulders, and finding emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and most of all diamonds. The dig lasted eight days,
and by the end,
was convinced: He told the investors that

proper machinery," he told them, “I would guarantee to send out one mil
lion dollars in diamonds every thirty days."
Returning to San Francisco a few days later, Ralston, Harpending, and
company acted fast to form a $10 million corporation of private investors.
First, however, they had to get rid of Arnold and Slack. That meant hiding
their excitement—they certainly did not want to reveal the field’s real
value. So they played possum. Who knows if _]anin is right, they told the
prospectors, the mine may not be as rich as we think. This just made the
prospectors angry. Trying a different tactic, the financiers told the two men
that if they insisted on having shares in the mine, they would end up being
fleeced by the unscrupulous tycoons and investors who would run the corporation; better, they said, to take the $700,000 already offerecl—an enor»
mous sum at the time—and
put their greed aside. This the prospectors
seemed to understand, and they finally agreed to take the money, in return

signing the rights to the site over to the financiers, and leaving maps to it.
News of the mine spread like wildfire. Prospectors fanned out across

Wyoming. Meanwhile Harpending and group began spending the millions
they had collected from their investors, buying equipment, hiring the best
men in the business, and furnishing luxurious offices in New York and San
Francisco.
A few weeks later, on their first trip back to the site, they learned the

hard truth: Not a single diamond or ruby was to be found. It was all a fake.

They were mined. Harpending had unwittingly lured the richest men in
the world into the biggest scam of the century.
Interpretation
Arnold and Slack pulled off their stupendous con not by using a fake engi-

bribing Tiffany: All of the experts had been real. All of them honestly believed in the existence of the mine and in the value of the gems.
What had fooled them all was nothing else than Arnold and Slack themselves. The two men seemed to be such rubes, such hayseeds, so naive, that
no one for an instant had believed them
capable of an audacious scam.
The prospectors had simply observed the law of appearing more stupid
neer or

than the mark-—the deceiver’s First Commandment.
158

LAW 21

The logistics of the con were quite simple. Months before Arnold and

Slack announced the “discovery” of the diamond mine, they traveled to

Europe, where they purchased some real gems for around $12,000 (part of
the money they had saved from their days as gold miners). They then
salted the “mine” with these gems, which the first expert dug up and
brought to San Francisco. The jewelers who had appraised these stones, in»
cluding Tiffany himself, had gotten caught up in the fever and had grossly
overestimated their value. Then Ralston gave the prospectors $l00,000 as
security, and immediately after their trip to New York they simply went to
Amsterdam, where they bought sacks of uncut gems, before ramming to
San Francisco. The second time they salted the mine, there were many
more jewels to be found.
The effectiveness of the scheme, however, rested not on tricks like

these but on the fact that Arnold and Slack played their parts to perfection.
On their trip to New York, where they mingled with millionaires and ty—
coons, they played up their clodhopper image, wearing pants and coats a
size or two too small and acting incredulous at everything they saw in the

big city. No one believed that these country simpletons could possibly be
conning the most devious, unscrupulous financiers of the time. And once
Harpending, Ralston, and even Rothschild accepted the mine’s existence,
anyone who doubted it was questioning the intelligence of the world’s most
successful businessmen.
In the end, Harpending’s reputation was mined and he never recovered; Rothschild learned his lesson and never fell for another con; Slack
took his money and disappeared from view, never to be found. Arnold

simply went home to Kentucky. After all, his sale of his mining rights had
been legitimate; the buyers had taken the best advice, and if the mine had
run out of diamonds, that was their problem. Arnold used the money to

greatly enlarge his farm and open up a bank of his own.

Given how important the idea of intelligence is to most people’s vanity, it is critical never inadvertently to insult or impugn a person’s brain
power. That is an unforgivable sin. But if you can make this iron rule work
for you, it opens up all sorts of avenues of deception. Sublirninally reassure
people that they are more intelligent than you are, or even that you are a
bit of a moron, and you can run rings around them. The feeling of intellee
tual superiority you give them will disarm their suspiciorrmuscles.

In 1865 the Prussian councillor Otto von Bismarck wanted Austria to

sign a certain treaty. The treaty was totally in the interests of Prussia and
against the interests of Austria, and Bismarck would have to strategize to
get the Ausmans to agree to it But the Austrian negotiator, Count Blorne,
was an avid
cardplayer. His particular game was quinze, and he often said
that he could judge a man’s character by the way he played quinze. Bismarck knew of this saying of Blome’s.
The night before the negotiations were to begin, Bismarck innocently

engaged Blome in a game of quinze. The Prussian would later write, “That
was the
very last time I ever played quinze. I played so recklessly that
everyone was astonished. I lost several thousand talers [the currency of the
time], but I succeeded in fooling [Blome], for he believed me to be more
venturesome than I am and I gave way.” Besides appearing reckless, Bismarck also played the witless fool, saying ridiculous things and bumbling
about with a surplus of nervous energy.
All this made Blome feel he had gadiered valuable information. He
knew that Bismarck was aggressive———the Prussian already had that reputation, and the way he played had confirmed it. And aggressive men, Blome
knew, can be foolish and rash. Accordingly, when the time came to Sign
the treaty, Blome thought he had the advantage. A heedless fool like Bis-

marck, he thought, is incapable of cold—blooded calculation and deception,
so he
only glanced at the treaty before signing it—he failed to read the fine
print. As soon as the ink was dry, a joyous Bismarck exclaimed in his face,
“Well, I could never have believed that I should find an Austrian diplomat
willing to sign that document!”
The Chinese have a phrase, “Masqueracling as a swine to kill the

clothes himself in the hide and snout of a pig, and mimics its grunting. The
mighty tiger thinks a pig is coming his way, and lets it get close, savoring
the prospect of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who has the last laugh.
Masquerading as a swine works wonders on those who, like tigers, are
arrogant and overconfident: The easier they think it is to prey on you, the
more
easily you can turn the tables. This trick is also useful if you are ambitious yet find yourself low in the hierarchy: Appearing less intelligent than
you are, even a bit of a fool, is the perfect disguise. Look like a harmless pig
and no one will believe you harbor dangerous ambitions. They may even

promote you since you seem so likable, and subservient. Claudius before
he became emperor of Rome, and the prince of France who later became
Louis XIII, used this tactic when those above them suspected they might
have designs on the throne. By playing the fool as young men, they were
left alone. When the time came for them to strike, and to act with vigor and

decisiveness, they caught everyone oi?-guard.

Intelligence is the obvious quality to downplay, but why stop there?
Taste and sophistication rank close to intelligence on the vanity scale;
make people feel they are more sophisticated than you are and their guard
will come down. As Arnold and Slack knew, an air of complete naiveté can

work wonders. Those fancy financiers were laughing at them behind their

I60

backs, but who laughed loudest in the end? In general, then, always make

people believe they are smarter and more sophisticated than you are. They
will keep you around because you make them feel better about themselves,
and the longer you are around, the more opportunities you will have to do
ceive them.

To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in

the habit of downplaying it at all times. If people inadvertently learn the
truth—-that you are actually much smarter than you look--«they will admire
you more for being discreet than for making your brilliance show. At the
start of your climb to the top, of course, you cannot play too stupid: You
may want to let your bosses know, in a subtle way, that you are smarter
than the competition around you. As you climb the ladder, however, you

should to some degree try to dampen your brilliance.
There is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite-

when you can cover up a deception with a show of intelligence. In matters
of smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you seem to
have authority and knowledge, people will believe what you say. This can
be very useful in getting you out of a scrape.

The critic studied it for a time, then finally said, “You know, I don’t think
this Diirer is right.” He followed the young woman as she hurried to tell
her father what he had said, and listened as the magnate, deeply unsettled,
turned to Duveen for reassurance. Duveen just laughed. “How very amusing,” he said. “Do you realize, young man, that at least twenty other art experts here and in Europe have been taken in too, and have said that
painting isn’t genuine? And now you’ve made the same mistake.” His confident tone and air of authority intimidated the Frenchman, who apologized for his mistake.

Duveen knew that the art market was flooded with fakes, and that
many paintings had been falsely ascribed to old masters. He tried his best
to distinguish the real from the fake, but in his zeal to sell he often over-

The Melians would not budge. Sparta, they insisted, would come to

The Athenians were one of the most eminently practical people in history,
and they made the most practical argument they could with the Melians:

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Sometime in the 19205 the German writer Bertolt Brecht became a convert

1941, accordingly, Brecht emigrated to the United States, and chose to settle in Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a living in the film business.

Over the next few years Brecht wrote screenplays with a pointedly an—
ticapitalist slant. He had little success in Hollywood, so in 1947, the war
having ended, he decided to return to Europe. That same year, however,
the US. Cong;ress’s House Un—American Activities Committee began its
investigation into supposed Communist infiltration in Hollywood. It began
to gather information on Brecht, who had so openly espoused Marxism,
and on September 19, 1947, only a month before he had planned to leave
the United States, he received a subpoena to appear before the committee.
In addition to Brecht, a number of other writers, producers, and directors
were summoned to appear as

well, and this group came to be known as the

Hollywood 19.
Before going to Washington, the Hollywood 19 met to decide on a plan
of action. Their approach would be confrontational. Instead of answering

questions about their membership, or lack of it, in the Communist Party,

they would read prepared statements that would challenge the authority of
the committee and argue that its activities were unconstitutional. Even if
this strategy meant imprisonment, it would gain publicity for their cause.

Brecht disagreed. What good was it, he asked, to play the martyr and

gain a little public sympathy if in the process they lost the ability to stage
their plays and sell their scripts for years to come? He felt certain they were
LAW 22

I65

all more intelligent than the members of the committee. Why lower themselves to the level of their opponents by arguing with them? Why not out
fox the committee by appearing to surrender to it while subtly mocking it?
The Hollywood 19 listened to Brecht politely, but decided to stick to their

plan, leaving Brecht to go his own way.
The committee finally summoned Brecht on October 30. They expected him to do what others among the Hollywood 19 who had testified
before him had done: Argue, refuse to answer questions, challenge the
committee's right to hold its hearing, even yell and hurl insults. Much to
their surprise, however, Brecht was the very picture of Congeniality. He
wore a suit
(something he rarely did), smoked a cigar (he had heard that
the committee chairman was a passionate cigar smoker), answered their
questions politely, and generally deferred to their authority.
Unlike the other witnesses, Brecht answered the question of whether
he belonged to the Communist Party: He was not a member, he said,
which happened to be the truth. One committee member asked him, “is it
true you have written a number of revolutionary plays?” Brecht had written many plays with overt Communist messages, but he responded, “I
have written a number of poems and songs and plays in the fight against

Hitler and, of course, they can be considered, therefore, as revolutionary

because I, of course, was for the overthrow of that government.” This state
ment went

unchallenged.

Brecht’s English was more than adequate, but he used an interpreter

throughout his testimony, a tactic that allowed him to play subtle games
with language. When committee members found Communist leanings in
lines from English editions of his poems, he would repeat the lines in Ger
man

for the interpreter, who would then retranslate them; and somehow

they would come out innocuous. At one point a committee member read
revolutionary poems out loud in English, and asked him if
he had written it. “No,” he responded, “I wrote a German poem, which is
one of Brechfs

very different from this.” The author's elusive answers baffled the committee members, but his politeness and the way he yielded to their authority
made it impossible for them to get angry with him.

After only an hour of questioning, the committee members had had

enough. “Thank you very much,” said the chairman, “You are a good example to the {other} witnesses.” Not only did they free him, they offered to
help him if he had any trouble with immigration oficials who might detain
him for their own reasons. The following day, Brecht left the United States,
never to return.

Interpretation
The Hollywood 19’s confrontational approach won them a lot of sympa~

thy, and years later they gained a kind of vindication in public opinion. But
they were also blacklisted, and lost valuable years of profitable working
time. Brecht, on the other hand, expressed his disgust at the committee
more
indirectly. It was not that he changed his beliefs or compromised his
values; instead, during his short testimony, he kept the upper hand by ap166

LAW 22

pearing to yield while all the time running circles around the committee
with vague responses, outright lies that went unchallenged because they
were wrapped in enigmas, and word games. In the end he kept the freedom to continue his revolutionary writing (as opposed to suffering impris
onment or detainment in the United States), even while subtly mocking the
committee and its authority with his pseudo-obedience.
Keep in mind the following: People trying to make a show of their authority are easily deceived by the surrender tactic. Your outward sign of
submission makes them feel important; satisfied that you respect them,

they become easier targets for a later counterattack, or for the kind of indi»
rect ridicule used by Brecht. Measuring your power over time, never sacrifice long-term maneuverability for the short-lived glories of martyrdom.

KEYS T0 POWER
What gets us into trouble in the realm of power is often our own overreac~
tion to the moves of our enemies and rivals. That overreaction creates

problems we would have avoided had we been more reasonable. It also
has an endless rebound effect, for the enemy then overreacts as well, much
as

the Athenians did to the Melians. It is always our first instinct to react, to

meet aggression with some other kind of aggression. But the next time
someone
pushes you and you find yourself starting to react, try this: Do not
resist or fight back, but yield, turn the other cheek, bend. You will find that

this often neutralizes their behavior——they expected, even wanted you to

ofiguard and confounded by your
lack of resistance. By yielding, you in fact control the situation, because
react with force and so they are caught

your surrender is part of a larger plan to lull them into believing they have
defeated you.
This is the essence of the surrender tactic: Inwardly you stay firm, but

outwardly you bend. Deprived of a reason to get angry, your opponents
will often be bewildered instead. And they are unlikely to react with more
violence, which would demand a reaction from you. Instead you are al
lowed the time and space to plot the countermoves that will bring them

down. In the battle of the intelligent against the brutal and the aggressive,
the surrender tactic is the supreme weapon. It does require self~control:
Those who

genuinely surrender give up their freedom, and may be
crushed by the humiliation of their defeat You have to remember that you

only appear to surrender, like the animal that plays dead to save its hide.
We have seen that it can be better to surrender than to fight; faced with
a. more
powerful opponent and a sure defeat, it is often also better to surrender than to run away. Running away may save you for the time being,
but the aggressor will eventually catch up with you.
you surrender instead, you have an opportunity to coil around your enemy and strike with
your fangs from close up.

In 473 B.C., in ancient China, King Goujian of Yue suffered a horrible
defeat from the ruler of Wu in the battle of Fujiao. Goujian wanted to flee,
but he had an adviser who told him to surrender and to place himself in the
service of the ruler of Wu, from which position he could study the man and

plot his revenge. Deciding to follow this advice, Goujian gave the ruler all
of his riches, and went to work in his conqueror’s stables as the lowest servant. For three years he humbled himself before the ruler, who then, finally
satisfied of his loyalty, allowed him to return home. Inwardly, however,
Goujian had spent those three years gathering information and plotting revenge. When a terrible drought struck Wu, and the kingdom was weak
ened by irmer turmoil, he raised an army, invaded, and won with ease.
That is the power behind surrender: It gives you the time and the flexibility
to plot a devastating counterblow. Had Goujian run away, he would have
lost this chance.
When foreign trade began to threaten Japanese independence in the
mid—nineteenth century, the Japanese debated how to defeat the foreigners. One

minister, Hotta Masayoshi, wrote a memorandum in 1857 that in-

fluenced Japanese policy for years to come: “I am therefore convinced that
our

policy should be to conclude friendly alliances, to send ships to foreign

counhies everywhere and conduct trade, to copy the foreigners where they
are at their best and so

repair our own shortcomings, to foster our national

strength and complete our armaments, and so gradually subject the foreigrr
ers to our influence until in the end all the countries of the world know the

blessings of perfect tranquillity and our hegemony is acknowledged
throughout the globe.” This is a brilliant application of the Law: Use surrender to gain access to your enemy. Learn his ways, insinuate yourself
with him slowly, outwardly conform to his customs, but inwardly maintain
your own culture. Eventually you will emerge victorious, for while he con—
siders you weak and inferior, and takes no precautions against you, you are
using the time to catch up and surpass him. This soft, penneable form of in»
vasion is often the best, for the enemy has nothing to react against, prepare
for, or resist. And had japan resisted Western influence by force, it might
well have suffered a devastating invasion that would have permanently altered its culture.
Surrender can also offer a way of mocking your enemies, of turning
their power against them, as it did for Brecht. Milan Kundera’s novel 7719

Jake, based on the author’s experiences in a penal camp in Czechoslovakia,
tells the story of how the prison guards organized a relay race, guards
against prisoners. For the guards this was a chance to show off their physical superiority. The prisoners knew they were expected to lose, so they
of their way to oblige-—miming exaggerated exertion while
barely moving, running a few yards and collapsing, limping, jogging ever

slowly while the guards raced ahead at full speed. Both by joining the
race and
by losing ig they had obliged the guards obediently; but their
so

“overobedience” had mocked the event to the point of mining it. Overobedience—su.rrender—was here a way to demonstrate superiority in a reverse manner. Resistance would

I65

LAW 22

have engaged the prisoners in the cycle of

violence, lowering them to the guards’ level. Overobeying the guards, how»
ever, made them ridiculous, yet they could not rightly punish the prison»
ers, who had only done what they asked.

Power is always in flux—since the game is by nature fluid, and an arena
of constant struggle, those with power almost always find themselves even-

tually on the downward swing. If you find yourself temporarily weakened,
the surrender tactic is perfect for raising yourselfup again»-it disguises your
ambition; it teaches you patience and self—control, key skills in the game;
and it puts you in the best possible position for taking advantage of your uppressofs sudden slide. If you run away or fight back, in the long run you
cannot win. If you surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious.

In China in the early sixth century B.C., the kingdom of Wu began a was

with the neighboring norlhem provinces of the Middle Kingdom. Wu was

growing power, but it lacked the great history and civilization of the Mid
dle Kingdom, for centuries the center of Chinese culture. By defeating the
a.

Middle Kingdom, the king of Wu would instantly raise his status.
The war began with great fanfare and several victories, but it soon
bogged down. A victory on one from would leave the Wu armies vulnera~
ble on another. The king’ s chief minister and adviser, Wu Tzu-hsiu, warned
him that the barbarous state of Yueh, to the south, was beginning to notice
the kingdom of V\’u’s problems and had designs to invade. The king only
laughed at such w0rries~one more big victory and the great Middle King—
dom would be his.
In the year 490, Wu T212-hsiu sent his son away to safety in the kingdom of Ch’i. In doing so he sent the king a signal that he disapproved of
the war, and that he believed the king’s selfish ambition was leading Wu to
min. The king, sensing betrayal, lashed out at his minister, accusing him of
a lack of

loyalty and, in a fit of anger, ordered him to kill himself. Wu Tzuhsiu obeyed his king, but before he plunged the knife into his chest, he
cried, “Tear out my eyes, oh King, and fix them on the gate of Wu, so that I
may see the triumphant entry of Yueh.”
As Wu Tzwlrsiu had predicted, within a few years a Yueh army passed

beneath the gate of Wu. As the barbarians surrounded the palace, the king
remembered his minister’s last Words-——~and felt the dead man’s disembod-

ied eyes watching his disgrace. Unable to hear his shame, the king killed

himself, “covering his face so that he would not have to meet the reproaclr
ful gaze of his minister in the next world.”

Interpretation
The story of Wu is a paradigm of all the empires that have come to min by

overreachlng. Drunk with success and sick with ambition, such empires ex‘
pand to grotesque proportions and meet a min that is total. This is what
happened to ancient Athens, which lusted for the faraway island of Sicily
and ended up losing its empire. The Romans stretched the boundaries of
their empire to encompass vast territories; in doing so they increased their
vulnerability, and the chances of invasion from yet another barbarian tribe.
Their useless expansion led their empire into oblivion.
For the Chinese, the fate of the kingdom of Wu serves as an elemental
lesson on what happens when you dissipate your forces on several fronts,
losing sight of distant dangers for the sake of present gain. “If you are not in
danger,” says Sun-tzu, “do not fight.” It is almost a physical law: What is
bloated beyond its proportions inevitably collapses. The mind must not
wander from goal to goal, or be distracted by success from its sense of purpose and proportion. What is concentrated, coherent, and connected to its
past has power. What is dissipated, divided, and distended rots and falls to
the ground. The bigger it bloats, the harder it falls.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW’
The Rothschild banking family had humble beginnings in the Jewish

ghetto of Frankfurt, Germany. The city‘s harsh laws made it impossible for
Jews to mingle outside the ghetto, but the Jews had turned this into a
virtuemit made them self—reliant, and zealous to preserve their culture at

all costs. Mayer Amschel, the first of the Rothschilds to accumulate wealth

by lending money, in the late eighteenth century, well understood the
power that comes from this kind of concentration and cohesion.
First, Mayer Amschel allied himself with one family, the powerful

princes of Thom und Taxis. Instead of spreading his services out, he made
himself these princes’ primary banker. Second, he entrusted none of his
business to outsiders, using only his children and close relatives. The more
unified and tight-knit the family, the more powerful it would become. Soon
Mayer Amschel’s five sons were running the business. And when Mayer
Amschel lay dying, in 1812, he refused to name a principal heir, instead setting up all of his sons to continue-the fa.mily' tradition, so that they would
stay united and would resist the dangers of dillusion and of infiltration by
outsiders.

CHAUCER.

Du. .l<)H.N Arum,

Once Mayer Amschel’s sons controlled the family business, they decided that the key to wealth on a. larger scale was to secure a foothold in the

l747~»lR22

finances of Europe as a whole, rather than being tied to any one country or

prince. Of the five brothers, Nathan had already opened up shop in London. In 1813 James moved to Paris. Amschel remained in Frankfurt,
Salomon established himself in Vienna, and Karl, the youngest son, went
to

Naples. With each sphere of influence covered, they could tighten their

hold on Europe’s financial markets.
This widespread network, of course, opened the Rothschilds to the
very danger of which their father had warned them: diliusion, division, dissension. They avoided this danger, and established themselves as the most

powerful force in European finance and politics, by once again resorting to
the strategy of the ghetto-——excluding outsiders, concentrating their forces.
The Rothschiids established the fastest courier system in Europe, allowing

them to get news of events before all their competitors. They held a virtual
monopoly on information. And their internal communications and correspondence were written in Frankfurt Yiddish, and in a code that only the

brothers could decipher. There was no point in stealing this information—no one could understand it.

“Even the shewdest bankers cannot find their

way through the Rothschild maze,” admitted a financier who had tried to
infiltrate the clan.
In 1824 James Rothschild decided it was time to get married. This presented a problem for the Rothschilds, since it meant incorporating an outsider into the Rothschild clan, an outsider who could betray its secrets.

jarnes therefore decided to marry within the family, and chose the daughter of his brother Salomon. The brothers were ecstatic—~this was the per-

fect solution to their marriage problems. james‘s choice now became the

family policy: Two years later, Nathan married off his daughter to

I73

Salornon’s son. In the years to come, the five brothers arranged eighteen

matches among their cluldren, sixteen of these being contracted between
first cousins.
“We are like the mechanism of a watch: Each part is essential,” said

brother Salomon. As in a watch, every part of the business moved in concert with every other, and the inner workings were invisible to the world,
which only saw the movement of the hands. While other rich and powerful

families suffered irrecoverable downturns during the tumultons first half of
the nineteenth century, the tight-knit Rothschilds managed not only to preserve but to

expand their unprecedented wealth.

Interpretation
The Rothschilds were born in strange times. They came from a place that
had not changed in centuries, but lived in an age that gave birth to the In-

dustrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and an endless series of upheavals. The Rothchilds

kept the past alive, resisted the patterns of

dispersion of their era and for this are emblematic of the law of concentration.

No one represents this better than _]ames Rothschild, the son who established himself in Paris. in his lifetime james witnessed the defeat of

Napoleon, the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, the bourgeois monarchy of Orleans, the return to a republic, and finally the enthronement of
Napoleo 1 III. French styles and fashions changed at a relentless pace during all this turmoil. Without appearing to be a relic of the past, James
steered his family as if the ghetto lived on within them. He kept alive his
clan’s inner cohesion and strength. Only through such an anchoring in the
past was the family able to thrive amidst such chaos. Concentration was the
foundation of the Rothschilds’ power, wealth, and stability.
The best stmzngy is always to be very strong; flrst in general, than
at the decisive point.

KEYS TO POWER

The world is plagued by greater and geater division-——within countries,

political groups, families, even individuals. We are all in a state of total distraction and diffusion, hardly able to keep our minds in one direction before we are pulled in a thousand others. The modern world’s level of
conflict is higher than ever, and we have internalized it in our own lives.
The solution is a form of retreat inside ourselves, to the past, to more
concentrated forms of thought and action. As Schopenhauer wrote, “Intellect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensity.” Napoleon

knew the value of concentrating your forces at the enemy’s weakest spot——

Ir-4

‘

LAW 23

it was the secret of his success on the battlefield. But his willpower and his

mind were equally modeled on this notion. Single-mindedness of purpose,

total concentration on the goal, and the use of these qualifies against peo

ple less focused, people in a state of distraction—such an arrow will find its
mark every time and overwhelm the enemy.
Casanova attributed his success in life to his ability to concentrate on a

single goal and push at it until it yielded. It was his ability to give himself
over

completely to the women he desired that made him so intensely se-

ducfive. For the weeks or months that one of these women lived in his

orbit, he thought of no one else. When he was imprisoned in the treacherof the doge’s palace in Venice, a prison from which no one had

ous “leads”

escaped, he concentrated his mind on the single goal of escape, day
after day. A change of cells, which meant that months of digging had all
ever

been for naught, did not discourage him; he persisted and eventually es-

caped. “I have always believed,” he later wrote, “that when a man gets it
into his head to do something, and when he exclusively occupies himself in

that design, he must succeed, whatever the diliiculties. That man will become Grand Vizier or

Pope.”

Concentrate C 1 a single goal, a single task, and beat it into submission.
In the world of power you will constantly need help from other people,

usually those more powerful than you. The fool flits from one person to another, believing that he will survive by spreading himself out. It is a corollary of the law of concentration, however, that much energy is saved, and
more power is attained, by affixing yourself to a single, appropriate source
of power. The scientist Nikola Tesla. mined himself by believing that he
somehow maintained his independence by not having to serve a single
P. Morgan, who offered him a rich conmaster. He even turned down
tract. In the end, Tesla’s “independence” meant that he could depend on
no
single patron, but was always having to toady up to a dozen of them.
Later in his life he realized his mistake.
All the great Renaissance painters and writers wrestled with this prob-

lem, none

more

so

than the

sixteenth-century writer Pietro Aretino.

Throughout his life Aretino suffered the indignities of having to please this
prince and that. At last, he had had enough, and decided to woo Charles
V, promising the emperor the services of his powerful pen. He finally discovered the freedom that came from attachment to

a

single source of

power. Michelangelo found this freedom with Pope Julius II, Galileo with
the Medicis. In the end, the singie patron appreciates your loyalty and becomes

dependent on your services; in the long run the master serves the

slave.

Finally, power itself always exists in concentrated forms. In any organization it is inevitable for a small youp to hold the strings. And often it is
not those with the titles. In the game of power,

only the fool llails about

without fixing his target. You must find out who controls the operations,
who is the real director behind the scenes. As Richelieu discovered at the

beginning of his rise to the top of the French political scene during the
LAW 23

I 75

early seventeenth century, it was not King Louis XIII who decided things,
it was the king’s mother. And so he attached himself to her, and catapulted
through the ranks of the courtiers, all the way to the top.
It is enough to strike oil once—your wealth and power are assured for
a

lifetime.

Authority: Prize intensity more than extensity. Perfection re»
sides in quality, not quantity. Extent alone never rises above
mediocrity, and it is the misfortune of men with wide general
interests that while they would like to have their finger in every
pie, they have one in none. Intensity gives eminence, and rises
to the heroic in matters sublime. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

REVERSAI.

There are dangers in concentration, and moments when dispersion is the
proper tactical move. Fighting the Nationalists for control of China, Mao
Tse~tung and the Communists fought a protracted war on several fronts,

using sabotage and ambush as their main weapons. Dispersal is often suitable for the weaker side; it is, in fact, a crucial principle of guerrilla warfare.
When fighting a stronger army, concentrating your forces only makes you
an

easier

ta.rget—better to dissolve into the scenery and frustrate your

enemy with the elusiveness of your presence.

Tying yourself to a single source of power has one preeminent danger:
If that person dies, leaves, or falls from grace, you suffer. This is what happened to Cesare Borgia, who derived his power from his father, Pope
Alexander VI. It was the pope who gave Cesare armies to fight with and
wars to
wage in his name. When he suddenly died (perhaps from poison),
I 76

LAW 23

Cesare was as good as dead. He had made far too many enemies over the
years, and was now without his father’s protection. In cases when you may
need protection, then, it is ofien wise to entwine yourself around several
sources of power. Such a move would be especially prudent in periods of

great tumult and violent change, or when your enemies are numerous. The
more patrons and masters
you serve the less risk you run if one of them
falls from power. Such dispersion will even allow you to play one off

against the other. Even if you concentrate on the single source of power,
you still must practice caution, and 1 cepare for the day when your master
or

patron is no longer there to help you.

Finally, being too singlerminded in purpose can make you an intolera~
ble bore, especially in the arts. The Renaissance painter Paolo Uccello was
so obsessed with

perspective that his paintings look lifeless and contrived.

Whereas Leonardo da Vinci interested himself in everything«-architecture, painting, warfare, sculpture, mechanics. Diffusion was the source of
his power. But such genius is rare, and the rest of us are better off erring on

the side of intensity.

COURT .‘3(C)ClE'l‘Y
It is a fact of human nature

that the structure of a court society forms itself

around power. In the past,‘ the court gathered around the ruler, and had
many functions: Besides keeping the ruler amused, it was a way to solidify
the hierarchy of royalty, nobility, and the upper classes, and to keep the

nobility both subordinate and close to the ruler, so that he could keep an
eye on them. The court serves power in many ways, but most of all it glorilles the ruler, providing him with a microcosmic world that must snuggle
to

please him.
To be a courtier was a dangerous game. A nineteentl1—century Arab

traveler to the

court

of Darfur, in what is now Sudan,

reported that

courtiers there had to do whatever the sultan did: If he were injured, they

had to suffer the same injury; if he fell off his horse during a hunt, they fell,
too. Mimicry like this appeared in couirs all over the world. More trouble
the danger of displeasing the ruler-—-one wrong move spelled
death or exile. The successful courtier had to walk a tightrope, pleasing but
some was

pleasing too much, obeying but somehow distinguishing himself from
the other courtiers, while also never distinguishing himself so far as to
not

make the ruler insecure.
Great courtiers throughout history have mastered the science of ma-

nipulating people. They make the king feel more kingly; they make everyone else fear their power. They are magicians of appearance, knowing that
most things at court are judged by how they seem. Great coui-tiers are grate
citrus and polite; their aggression is veiled and indirect, Masters of the
word, they never say more than necessary, getting the most out of a cornpliment or hidden insult. They are magnets of pleasure—people want to be
around them because they know how to please, yet they neither fawn nor
humiliate themselves. Great courtiers become the king’s favorites, enjoying
the benefits of that position. They often end up more powerful than the

ruler, for they are wizards in the accumulation of influence.

Many today dismiss court life as a relic of the past, a historical curiosity. They reason, according to Machiavelli, “as though heaven, the sun, the
elements, and men had changed the order of their motions and power, and
were

different from what they were in ancient limes.” There may be no

more Sun

Kings but there are still plenty of people who believe the sun re-

volves around them. The royal court may have more or less disappeared,
or at least lost its power, but courts and courtlers still exist because power

still exists. A courtier is rarely asked to fall off a horse anymore, but the
laws that govern court politics are as timeless as the laws of power. There is
much to be leamed, then, from great courtiers past and present.

will take it as a form of condescension, which it is, and those above you will
be ofiended, although they may not admit it. You must change your style
and your way of speaking to suit each person. This is not lying, it is acting,
and acting is an art, not a gift from God. Learn the art. This is also true for
the great variety of cultures found in the modern court: Never assume that

Rather than making yourself the supplicant, it is always better to earn your

favors, so that the ruler bestows them willingly. Most important: Do not ask
for favors on another person’s behalf, least of all a friend’s.
Never joke About Appearances or Taste. A lively wit and a humorous

disposition are essential qualifies for a good courtier, and there are times
when vulgarity is appropriate and engaging. But avoid any kind of joke
about appearance or taste, two highly sensitive areas, especially with those
above you. Do not even try it when you are away from them. You will dig
your own grave.
Do Not Be the Court Cynic.

Express admiration for the good work of

others. If you constantly criticize your equals or subordinates some of that
criticism will rub off on you, hovering over you like a gray cloud wherever

you go. People will groan at each new cynical comment, and you will irn'~

people’s achievements, you paradoxically call attention to your own. The ability to express
wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and dying talent, but one still greatly valued.
Be Self-observant. The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it you
would commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also need a mirror for

your actions. This can sometimes come from other people telling

try to see yourself as others see

SCENES OF COURT Ll FE: Exemplary Deeds and Fatal Mistakes
Scene 1
Alexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East through to India, had had the great Aristotle as his tutor and mentor, and throughout his short life he remained devoted to philosophy and
his master’s teachings. He once complained to Aristotle that during his

long campaigns he had no one with whom he could discuss philosophical
matters. Aristotle responded by suggesting that he take Callisthenes, a former
pupil of Aristotle’s and a promising philosopher in his own right,
along on the next campaign.
Aristotle had schooled Callisthenes in the skills of being a courtier, but
182

LAW '24

the young man secretly scoffed at them. He believed in pure philosophy, in

Imadorned words, in speaking the naked truth. If Alexander loved learning
so

much, Callisthenes thought, he could not object to one who spoke his

mind. During one of Alexander’s major campaigns, Callisthenes spoke his
mind one too many times and Alexander had him put to death.

Interpretation
In court, honesty is a fool’s game. Never be so self-absorbed as to believe
that the master is interested in your criticisms of him, no matter how accurate

they are.

Scene II

Beginning in the Han Dynasty two thousand years ago, Chinese scholars
compiled a series of writings called the 27 Histories, an official biography of
each dynasty, including stories, statistics, census figures, and war chronicles. Each history also contained a chapter called “Unusual Events,” and
here, among the listings of earthquakes and floods, there would sometimes
suddenly appear descriptions of such bizarre manifestations as two—headed
sheep, geese flying backward, stars suddenly appearing in different parts of
the sky, and so on. The earthquakes could be historically verified, but the
monsters and weird natural phenomena were clearly inserted on purpose,
and invariably occurred in clusters. What could this mean?
The Chinese emperor was considered more than a man—he was a
force of nature. His kingdom was the center of the universe, and every-

thing revolved around him. He embodied the world’s perfection. To criticize him or any of his actions would have been to criticize the divine order.

No minister or courtier dared approach the emperor with even the slightest

cautionary word. But emperors were fallihle and the kingdom suffered
greatly by their mistakes. Inserting sightings of strange phenomena into the
court chronicles was the

only way to warn them. The emperor would read

of geese flying backward and moons out of orbit, and realize that he was

being cautioned. His actions were unbalancing the universe and needed to
change.
interpretation
For Chinese courtiers, the problem of how to give the emperor advice was
an
important issue. Over the years, thousands of them had died trying to
warn or counsel their master. To be made
safely, their criticisms had to be
if
were ton indirect
indirect--yet they
they would not be heeded. The
chronicles were their solution: Identify no one person as the source of criti«
cism, make the advice as impersonal as possible, but let the emperor know
the gravity of the situation.

Your master is no longer the center of the universe, but he still imagines that everything revolves around him. When you criticize him he sees

the person criticizing, not the criticism itself. Like the Chinese courtiers,
you must find a way to disappear behind the warning. Use symbols and
other indirect methods to paint a picture of the problems to come, without

putting your neck on the line.

Scene III
Early in his career, the French architect Jules Mansart received commissions to design minor additions to Versailles for King Louis XIV. For each

design he would draw up his plans, making sure they followed Louis’s instructions closely. He would then present them to His Majesty.
The courtier Saint-Simon described MansaIt’s technique in dealing
with the king: “His particular skill was to show the king plans that pur»
posely included something imperfect about them, often dealing with the
gardens, which were not Mansart’s specialty. The king, as Mansart expected, would put his finger exactly on the problem and propose how to
solve it, at which point Mansart would exclaim for all to hear that he would
never have seen

the problem that the king had so masterfully found and

solved; he would burst with admiration, confessing that next to the king he
was

but a lowly pupil.” At the age of thirty, having used these methods

time and time again, Mansart received a prestigious royal commission: Al:

though he was less talented and experienced than a number of other
French designers, he was to take charge of the enlargement of Versailles.
He was the king’s architect from then on.
Interpretation
As a young man, Mansart had seen how many royal craftsmen in the sen
vice of Louis XIV had lost their positions not through a lack of talent but
through a costly social blunder. He would not make that mistake. Mansart
always strove to make Louis feel better about himself, to feed the king’s
vanity as publicly as possible.
Never imagine that skill and talent are all that matter. In court the

courtier’s art is more important than his talent; never spend so much time
your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the greatest skill of
all is the ability to make the master look more talented than those around
on

him.
Scene IV

Jean-Baptiste Isabey had become the unofficial painter of the Napoleonic
court. During the Congress of Vienna in 1814, after Napoleon, defeated,
had been imprisoned on the island of Elba, the participants in these meetings, which were to decide the fate of Europe, invited Isabey to immortalize the historic events in an epic painting.
When Isabey arrived in Vienna, Talleyrand, the main negotiator for
the French, paid the artist a visit. Considering his role in the proceedings,
the statesman explained, he expected to occupy center stage in the painting. Isabey cordially agreed. A few days later the Duke of Wellington, the
main negotiator for the English, also approached Isabey, and said much
the same thing that Talleyrand had. The ever polite Isabey agreed that the
great duke should indeed he the center of attention.
Back in his studio, Isabey pondered the dilemma. If he gave the spotlight to either of the two men, he could create a diplomatic rift, stirring up
all sorts of resentment at a time when peace and concord were critical.

When the painting was finally unveiled, however, both Talleyrand and

Wellington felt honored and satisfied. The work depicts a large hall filled
with diplomats and politicians from allover Europe. 011 one side the Duke
of Wellington enters the room, and all eyes are turned toward him; he is
the “center” of attention. In the very center of the painting, meanwhile, sits

Talleyiand.
Interpretafion
It is often very difficult to satisfy the master, but to satisfy two masters in
one stroke takes the
mon

genius of a great courtier. Such predicaments are comw

in the life of a courtier: By giving attention to one master, he dis-

pleases another. You must find a way to navigate this Scylla and Charybdis
safely. Masters must receive their due; never inadvertently stir up the re
sentment of one in pleasing another.
Scene V

George Brummell, also known as Beau Brummell, made his mark in the
late 1700s by the supreme elegance of his appearance, his popularization of

shoe buckles (soon imitated by all the dandies). and his clever way with
words. His London house was the fashionable spot in town, and Brunnnell
was the authority on all matters of fashion. If he disliked your footwear,
you immediately got rid of it and bought whatever he was wearing. He perfected the art of tying a cravat; Lord Byron was said to spend many a night
in front of the mirror trying to figure out the secret behind Brummell’s per-

fect knots.
One of Brummell’s greatest admirers was the Prince of Wales, who
fancied himself a fashionable young man. Becoming attached to the

prince’s court (and provided with a royal pension), Brummell was soon so
sure of his‘ own authority there that he took to joking about the prince’s
weight, referring to his host as Big Ben. Since trimness of figure was an im~
portant quality for a. dandy, this was a withering criticism. At dinner once,
when the service was slow, Brummell said to the prince, “Do ting, Big
Ben” The prince rang, but when the valet arrived he ordered the man to
show Brummell the door and never admit him again.

Despite falling into the prince’s disfavor, Brummell continued to treat
everyone around him with the same arrogance. Without the Prince of
Wales’ patronage to support him, he sank into horrible debt, but he main
tained his insolent manners, and everyone soon abandoned him. He died
in the most pitiahle poverty, alone and deranged.

Interpretation
Beau Brummell’s devastating wit was one of the qualifies that endeared
him to the Prince of Wales. But not even he, the arbiter of taste and fashion,
could get away with a joke about the prince’s appearance, least of all to his
face. Never joke about a person’s plumpness, even indirectly—and particu*

larly when he is your master. The poorhouses of history are filled with people who have made such jokes at their master’s expense.

Pope Urban VIII wanted to be remembered for his skills in writing poetry,
which unfortunately were mediocre at best. In 1629 Duke Francesco
d’Este, knowing the pope’s literary pretensions, sent the poet Fulvio Testi
as his
ambassador to the Vatican. One of Tes|i’s letters to the duke reveals
why he was chosen: “Once our discussion was over, I kneeled to depart,
but His Holiness made a signal and walked to another room where he
sleeps, and after reaching a small table, he grabbed at bundle of papers and
thus, turning to me with a smiling face, he said: ‘We want Your Lordship to
listen to some of our compositions.’ And, in fact, he read me two very long
Pindaric poems, one in praise of the most hoiy Virgin, and the other one
about Countess Matilde.”
We do not know exactly what Testi thought of these very long poems,
since it would have been dangerous for him to state his opinion freely,
even in a letter. But he went on to write, “I,
following the mood, commented on each line with the needed praise, and, after having kissed His

Holiness’s foot for such an unusual sign of benevolence [the reading of the

poetry], I left.” Weeks later, when the duke himself visited the pope, he
managed to recite entire verses of the pope’s poetry and praised it enough
to make the pope “so jubilant he seemed to lose his mind.”

Interpretation
In matters of taste you can never be too obsequious with your master. Taste
is one of the ego’s pxickliest parts; never impugn or question the master’s

taste-——his poetry is sublime, his dress impeccable, and his manner the
model for all.

Scene VII
One afternoon in ancient China, Chao, ruler of Han from 358 to 333 B.C.,

got drunk and fell asleep in the palace gardens. The court crown-keeper,
whose sole task was to look after the ruler’s head apparel, passed through
the gardens and saw his master sleeping without a coat. Since it was getting

cold, the crowrrkeeper placed his own coat over the ruler, and left.
When Chan awoke and saw the coat upon him, he asked his axten»
dants, “Who put more clothes on my body?” “The crowmkeeper,” they

replied. The ruler immediately called for his ofiicial coat—keeper and had
him punished for neglecting his duties. He also called for the

crown-

keeper, whom he had beheaded.
Interpretation
Do not overstep your bounds. Do what you are assigned to do, to the best
of your abilities, and never do more. To think that by doing more you are

doing better is a common blunder. It is never good to seem to be trying too
ha.rd——-it is as if you were covering up some deficiency. Fulfilling a task that
has not been asked of you just makes people suspicious. If you are a crownkeeper, be a crowmkeeper. Save your excess energy for when you are not
in the court.

One day, for amusement, the Italian Renaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi

(1406-1469) and some friends went sailing in a small boat off Ancona.
There they were captured by two Moorish galleys, which hauled them off
in chains to Barbary, where they were sold as slaves. For eighteen long

months Filippo toiled with no hope of returning to Italy.
On several occasions Filippo saw the man who had bought him pass
by, and one day he decided to sketch this man’s portrait, using burnt
coal~charcoal—from the fire. Still in his chains, he found a white wall,
where he drew a full—length likeness of his owner in Moorish clothing. The
owner soon heard about

this, for no one had seen such skill in drawing be-

fore in these parts; it seemed like a miracle, 3. gift from God. The drawing

pleased the owner that be instantly gave Filippo his freedom and em—
ployed him in his court. All the big men on the Barbary coast came to see
the magnificent color portraits that Fra Filippo then proceeded to do, and
finally, in gratitude for the honor in this way brought upon him, Filippcfs
owner returned the artist
safely to Italy.
lnterpretation
We who toil for other people have all in some way been captured by pirates and sold into slavery. But like Fra Filippo (if to a lesser degree), most
of us possess some gift, some talent, an ability to do something better than
other people. Make your master a gift of your talents and you will rise
above other courtiers. Let him take the credit if necessary, it will only be
temporary: Use him as a stepping stone, a way of displaying your talent
and eventually buying your freedom from enslavernent.

pile of gold florins. The king smiled and said, “Don't believe in

In his treatment of the servant’s first dream, Alfonso remained in control.

By making a dream come true, he claimed a godlike power for himself, if
in a mild and humorous way. In the second dream, however, all appear-

magic was gone; this was nothing but an ugly con game on the set»
vant’s part. Never ask for too much, then, and know when to stop. It is the
master’s prerogative to give——to give when he wants and what he wants,

The great English landscape painter

M. W. Turner (1775-1851)

was

known for his use of color, which he applied with a brilliance and a strange
iridescence. The color in his paintings was so striking, in fact, that other
artists never wanted his work hung next to theirs: It inevitably made everything around it seem dull.
The painter Sir Thomas Lawrence once had the misfortune of seeing
Turner’s masterpiece Cologne hanging in an exhibition between two works
of his own. Lawrence complained bitterly to the gallery owner, who gave
him no satisfaction: After all, someone’: paintings had to hang next to
Tumer’s. But Turner heard of Lawrence’s complaint, and before the exhibition opened, he toned down the brilliant golden sky in Cologne, making it as

dull as the colors in Lawrence’s works. A friend of Tumer’s who saw the

painting approached the artist with a horrified look: “What have you done

picture!” he said. “Well, poor Lawrence was so unhappy,” Turner
replied, “and it’s only lampblack. It’ll wash off after the exhibition.”
Interpretation
Many of a courtier’s anxieties have to do with the master, with whom most
dangers lie. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that the master is the only one to
determine your fate. Your equals and subordinates play integral parts also.
A court is a vast stew of resentments, fears, and powerful envy. You have to
placate everyone who might someday harm you, deflecting their resentment and envy and diverting their hostility onto other people.
Turner, eminent courtier, knew that his good fortune and fame de
pended on his fellow painters as well as on his dealers and patrons. How
many of the great have been felled by envious colleagues! Better temporarily to dull your brilliance than to suffer the slings and arrows of envy.

On a tour through the United States once, Churchill visited Luce in his

THE DELEGATE GAME OF COURTIERSHIP: A Warning

Talleyraud was the consummate courtier, especially in serving his master
Napoleon. When the two men were first getting to know each other,
Napoleon once said in passing, “I shall come to lunch at your house one of
these days.” Talleyrancl had a house at Auteuil, in the suburbs of Paris. “I
should be delighted, man général,” the minister replied, “and since my
house is close to the Bois de Boulogne, you will be able to amuse yourself
with a bit of shooting in the afternoon.”
“I do not like shooting,” said Napoleon, “But I love hunting. Are there
any boars in the Bois de Boulogne?” Napoleon came from Corsica, where
boar hunting was a great sport. By asking if there were boars in at Paris
park, he showed himself still a. provincial, almost a tube. Talleyrand did not
laugh, however, but he could not resist a practical joke on the man who
was now his master in
politics, although not in blood and nobility, since
came
from
an
old aristocratic family. To Napoleorfs question,
Talleyrand
he
then,
simply replied, “Very few, man généml, but I dare say you will manage to find one.”

It was arranged that Napoleon would arrive at Talleyrand’s house the
following day at seven AM. and would spend the morning there. The “boar
hunt” would take place in the afternoon. Throughout the morning the excited general talked nothing but boar hunting. Meanwhile, Talleyrand see

cretly had his servants go to the market, buy two enormous black pigs, and
take them to the great park.
After

lunch, the hunters and their hounds set off for the Bois de

Boulogne. At a secret signal from Talleyrand, the servants loosed one of the
pigs. “I see a boar,” Napoleon cried joyfully, jumping onto his horse to give
chase. Talleyrand stayed behind. It took half an hour of galloping through
the park before the “boat” was finally captured. At the moment of triumph,
however, Napoleon was approached by one of his aides, who knew the
creature could not possibly be at boar, and feared the general would be
ridiculed once the story got out: “Sir,” he told Napoleon, “you realize of
course that this is not a bear but a
pig.”
Flying into a rage, Napoleon immediately set off at a gallop for Talleyrand’s house. He realized along the way that he would now be the butt
of many a joke, and that exploding at Talleyrand would only make him
'

LAW 24

199

more

ridiculous; it would be better to make a show of good humor. Still, he

did not hide his displeasure well.

Talleyrand decided to try to soothe the general’s bruised ego. He told
Napoleon not to go back to Paris yet-«he should again go hunting in the
park. There were many rabbits there, and hunting them had been a. favorite pastime of Louis XVI. Talleyrand even offered to let Napoleon use a
set of guns that had once belonged to Louis. With much flattery and cajol—
ery, he once again got Napoleon to agree to a hunt.
The party left for the park in the late afternoon. Along the way,
Napoleon told Talleyrand, “Pm not Louis XVI, I surely won’t kill even one
rabbit.” Yet that afternoon, strangely enough, the park was teeming with
rabbits. Napoleon killed at least fifty of them, and his mood changed from
anger to satisfaction. At the end of his wild shooting spree, however, the
same aide
approached him and whispered in his ear, “To tell the truth, sir, I
am
beginning to believe these are not wild rabbits. I suspect that rascal T31»
leyrand has played another joke on us.” (The aide was right: Talleyrand
had in fact sent his servants back to the market, where they had purchased
dozens of rabbits and then had released them in the Bois de Boulogne.)
Napoleon immediately mounted his horse and galloped away, this
time returning straight to Paris. He later threatened Talleyrand, warned
him not to tell a soul what had happened; if he became the laughingstock
of Paris, there would be hell to pay.

It took months for Napoleon to be able to trust Talleyrand again, and
he never totally forgave him his humiliation.

Interpretation
Courtiers are like magicians: They deceptively play with appearances,

only letting those around them see what they want them to see. With so
much deception and manipulation afoot, it is essential to keep people from
seeing your tricks and glimpsing your sleight of hand.
Talleyrand was normally the Grand Vlfizard of Courtiership, and but
for Napoleoifs aide, he probably would have gotten away completely with
both pleasing his master and having a joke at the generafs expense. But
courtiership is a subtle art, and overlooked traps and inadvertent mistakes
can ruin your best tricks. Never risk
being caught in your maneuvers;
never let
people see your devices. If that happens you instantly pass in peo
ple’s perceptions from a courtier of great manners to a loathsome rogue. It
is a delicate game you play; apply the utmost attention to covering your
tracks, and never let your master unmask you.

Julius Caesar made his first significant mark on Roman society in 65 B.C.,
when he assumed the post of aedile, the official in charge of grain distribution and public games. He began his entrance into the public eye by orga~
nizing a series of carefully crafted and well~timed spectac|es——wi1d—beast
hunts, extravagant gladiator shows, theatrical contests. On several occasions, he paid for these spectacles out of his own pocket. To the common
man, Julius Caesar became indelibly associated with these muclrloved
events. As he slowly rose to attain the position of consul, his popularity
among the masses served as the foundation of his power. He had created
an
image of himself as a great public showman.
In 49 B.C., Rome was on the brink of a civil war between rival leaders,
Caesar and Pompey. At the height of the tension, Caesar, an addict of the

stage, attended a theatrical performance, and afterward, lost in thought, he

making Caesar dictator of Rome.
In warfare, Caesar always played the leading man with gusto. He was
as skilled a horseman as any of his soldiers, and took pride in outdoing
them in feats of bravery and endurance, He entered battle astzide the
strongest mount, so that his soldiers would see him in the thick of battle,

urging them on, always positioning himself in the center, a godlike symbol
of power and a model for them to follow, Of all the armies in Rome, Caesar’s was the most devoted and loyal. His soldiers, like the common people

who had attended his entertainments, had come to identify with him and
with his cause.
After the defeat of Pompey, the entertainments grew in scale. Nothing
like them had ever been seen in Rome. The chariot races became more

spectacular, the gladiator fights more dramatic, as Caesar staged fights to
the death among the Roman nobility. He organized enormous mock naval

battles on an artificial lake. Plays were performed in every Roman ward. A

192

LAW 25

giant new theater was built that sloped dramatically down the Tarpeian
Rock. Crowds from all over the empire flocked to these events, the roads to
Rome lined with visitors’ tents. And in 45 B.C., timing his entry into the city
for maximum effect and surprise, Caesar brought Cleopatra back to Rome
after his Egyptian campaign, and staged even more extravagant public

spectacles.
These events were more than devices to divert the masses; they dra~

matically enhanced the public’s sense of Caesar’s character, and made him
seem larger than life. Caesar was the master of his public image, of which
he was forever aware. When he appeared before crowds he wore the most
spectacular purple robes. He would be upstaged by no one. He was notoriously vain about his appearance—it was said that one reason he enjoyed
being honored by the Senate and people was that on these occasions he
could wear a laurel wreath, hiding his baldness. Caesar was a masterful orator. He knew how to say a lot by saying a little, intuited the moment to
end a speech for maximum effect. He never failed to incorporate a surprise
into his public appearances—a startling announcement that would
heighten their drama.
Immensely popular among the Roman people, Caesar was hated and
feared by his rivals. On the ides of March——March 15—in the year 44 B.C.,
a
group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius surrounded him in the
senate and stabbed him to death. Even dying, however, he kept his sense of
drama. Drawing the top of his gown over his face, he let go of the cloth’s
lower part so that it draped his legs, allowing him to die covered and decent. According to the Roman historian Suetonius, his final words to his
old friend Brutus, who was about to deliver a second blow, were in Greek,
and as if rehearsed for the end of a play: “You too, my child?”

Interpretation
The Roman theater was an event for the masses, attended by crowds

unimaginable today. Packed into enormous auditoriums, the audience
would be amused by raucous comedy or moved by high tragedy. Theater
seemed to contain the essence of life, in its concentrated, dramatic form.
Like a religious ritual, it had a powerful, instant appeal to the common
man.

Julius Caesar was perhaps the first public figure to understand the vital
link between power and theater. This was because of his own obsessive in»
terest in drama. He sublimated this interest

by making himself an actor and

director on the world stage. He said his lines as if they had been scripted;
he gestured and moved through a crowd with a constant sense of how he

appeared to his audience. He incorporated surprise into his repertoire,
building drama into his speeches, staging into his public appearances. His
gestures were broad enough for the common man to grasp them instantly.
He became immensely popular.‘
Caesar set the ideal for all leaders and people of power. Like him, you
must leam to enlarge your actions through dramatic techniques such as
LAW 25

19.?

surprise, suspense, the creation of sympathy, and symbolic identification.
Also like him, you must be constantly aware of your audience——of what
will please them and what will bore them. You must arrange to place yourself at the center, to command attention, and never to be upstaged at any
cost.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In the year 1831, a young woman named Aurore Dupin Dudevant left her
husband and family in the provinces and moved to Paris. She wanted to be
a

writer; marriage, she felt, was worse than prison, for it left her neither the

time nor the freedom to pursue her passion. In Paris she would establish

her independence and make her living by writing.
Soon after Dudevant arrived in the capital, however, she had to con
front certain harsh realities. To have any degree of freedom in Paris you
had to have money. For a woman, money could only come through mar»

rlage or prostitution. No woman had ever come close to making a living by
writing. Women wrote as a hobby, supported by their husbands, or by an
inheritance. In fact when Dudevant first showed her writing to an editor,
he told her, “You should make babies, Madame, not literature,”
Clearly Dudevant had come to Paris to attempt the impossible. In the
end, though, she came up with a strategy to do what no woman had ever
donew-a strategy to re-create herself completely, forging a public image of
her own making. Women writers before her had been forced into a ready-

role, that of the second-rate arfist who wrote mostly for other
play a role, she would turn the
game around: She would play the part of a man.
In 1832 a publisher accepted Dudevanfs first major novel, Indium.
She had chosen to publish it under a pseudonym, “George Sand,” and all
of Paris assumed this impressive new writer was male. Dudevant had
sometimes worn men’s clothes before creating “George Sand” (she had almade

women. Dudevant decided that if she had to

ways found men‘s shirts and riding breeches more comfortable); now, as
a
public figure, she exaggerated the image. She added long men’s coats,

gray hats, heavy boots, and dandyish cravats to her wardrobe. She smoked
cigars and in conversation expressed herself like a man, unafraid to domiv
nate the conversation or to use a. saucy word,

This strange “male/female” writer fascinated the public. And unlike
other women writers, Sand found herself accepted into the clique of male
artists. She drank and smoked with them, even carried on affairs with the
most famous artists of Europe—Musset, Liszt,

Chopin. It was she who did

the wooing, and also the abandoning-—she moved on at her discretion.
Those who knew Sand well understood that her male persona protected her from the public’s prying eyes. Out in the world, she enjoyed

playing the part to the extreme; in private she remained herself. She also
realized that the character of “George Sand” could grow stale or predictable, and to avoid this she would every now and then dramatically alter
194

L AW 25

the character she had created; instead of conducting affairs with famous
men, she would begin meddling in politics, leading demonstrations, inspir-

ing student rebellions. No one would dictate to her the limits of the character she had created. Long after she died, and after most people had stopped
reading her novels, the larger-than—life theatricality of that character has
continued to fascinate and inspire.
Interpretation

Throughout Sand’s public life, acquaintances and other artists who spent
time in her company had the feeling they were in the presence of a man.
But in her journals and to her closest friends, such as Gustave Flaubert, she

confessed that she had no desire to be a man, but was playing a part for

public consumption. What she really wanted was the power to determine
her own character. She refused the limits her society would have set on her.
She did not attain her power, however, by being herself; instead she created a persona that she could constantly adapt to her own desires, a persona that attracted attention and gave her presence.

sands of years, only kings and the highest courtiers had the freedom to
shape their public image and determine their own identity. Similarly, only
kings and the wealthiest lords could contemplate their own image in art,
and consciously alter it. The rest of mankind played the limited role that
society demanded of them, and had little selficonsciousness.
A shift in this condition can be detected in Velézquez’s painting La:
Marinas, made in 1656. The artist appears at the left of the canvas, standing
before a painting that he is in the process of creating. but that has its back
to us——-we cannot see it. Beside him stands a princess, her attendanw, and
one of the court dwarves, all
watching him work. The people posing for the
are

directly visible, but we can see them in tiny reflections in a
mirror on the back wal]—-—the king and queen of
Spain, who must be sitting
somewhere in the foreground, outside the picture.
The painting represents a dramatic change in the dynamics of power
and the ability to determine one’s own position in society. For Velazquez,
the artist, is far more prominently positioned than the king and queen. In a
sense he is more
powerful than they are, since he is clearly the one control»
ling the irnage--their image. Velazquez no longer saw himself as the slavish, dependent artist. He had remade himself into a man of power. And
indeed the first people other than aristocrats to play openly with their
image in Western society were artists and writers, and later on dandies and
bohemians. Today the concept of selflcreation has slowly filtered down to
the rest of society, and has become an ideal to aspire to. Like Velazquez,
you must demand for yourself the power to determine your position in the
painting, and to create your own image.
The first step in the process of self—creation is self-consciousness-

being aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your appearance
and emotions. As Diderot said, the bad actor is the one who is always sincere.
People who wear their hearts on their sleeves out in society are tiresome and
embarrassing. Their sincerity notwithstanding, it is hard to take
them seriously. Those who cry in public may temporarily elicit sympathy,
but sympathy soon turns to scorn and irritation at their selfobsessiveness-«~they are crying to get attention, we feel, and a malicious
part of us wants to deny them the satisfaction.
Good actors control themselves better. They can play sincere and

heartfelt, can affect a tear and a compassionate look at will, but they don’t
have to feel it. They externalize emotion in a form that others can understand. Method acting is fatal in the real world. No ruler or leader could

possibly play the part if all of the emotions he showed had to be real. So
learn self-control. Adopt the plasticity of the actor, who can mold his or her
face to the emotion required.
The second step in the process of selflcreation is a Variation on the

George Sand strategy: the creation of a memorable character, one that
compels attention, that stands out above the other players on the stage.
This was the game Abraham Lincoln played. The homespun, common
country man, he knew, was a kind of president that America had never had
196

LAW 25

but would delight in electing. Although many of these qualifies came natu-

rally to him, he played them up--the hat and clothes, the beard. (No president before him had worn a beard.) Lincoln was also the first president to
use photographs to spread his image, helping to create the icon of the
“homespun president.”
Good drama, however, needs more than an interesting appearance, or
a single stand-out moment. Drama takes place over time—~it is an unfolding event Rhythm and timing are critical. One of the most important ele
ments in the rhythm of drama is suspense. Houdini for instance, could
sometimes complete his escape acts in seconds——but he drew them out to
minutes, to make the audience sweat.
The key to keeping the audience on the edge of their seats is letting
events unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right moment, accord-

ingto a pattern and tempo that you control. Great rulers from Napoleon to
Mao Tseturig have used theatrical timing to surprise and divert their pub
lic. Franklin Delano Roosevelt understood the importance of staging polio»
cal events in R particular order and rhythm.
At the time of his 1932 presidential election, the United States was in

the midst of a dire economic crisis. Banks were failing at an alarming rate.

Shortly after winning the election, Roosevelt went into at kind of retreat.
He said nothing about his plans or his cabinet appointments, He even re~
fused to meet the sitting president, Herbert Hoover, to discuss the transition. By the time of Roosevelt’s inauguration the country was in a state of

high anxiety.
In his inaugural address, Roosevelt shifted gears. He made a powerful
speech, making it clear that he intended to lead the country in a completely
new direction,
sweeping away the timid gestures of his predecessors. From
then on the pace of his speeches and public decisions——cabinet appointments, bold legislatiori—~unfolded at an incredibly rapid rate. The period
after the inauguration became known as the “Hundred Days,” and its suc-

altering the country’s mood partly stemmed from Roosevelfs clever
pacing and use of dramatic contrast. He held his audience in suspense,

then hit them with a series of bold gestures that seemed all the more momentous because

they came from nowhere. You must learn to orchestrate

events in a similar manner, never

heightens their dramatic effect.
Besides covering a multitude of sins, good drama can also confuse and
deceive your enemy. During World War II, the German playwright Bertolt

Brecht worked in Hollywood as a screenwriter. After the war he was called

before the House Committee on Un-American Activities for his supposed
Communist

sympathies. Other writers who had been called to testify

humiliate the committee members with an angry emotional
planned
stand. Brecht was wiser: He would play the committee like a violin, charmv
to

ing them while fooling them as well. He carefully rehearsed his responses,
and brought along some props, notably a cigar on which he puffed away,
knowing the head of the committee hked cigars. And indeed he proceeded
LAW 25

197

to beguile the committee with well—crafted responses that were

ambiguous,
funny, and double—edged. Instead of an angry, heartfelt tirade, he ran circles around them with a staged production, and they let him off scot-free.
Other dramatic effects for your repertoire include the beau geste, an
action at a climactic moment that symbolizes your triumph or your boldness. Caesar’s dramatic
crossing of the Rubicon was a beau geste——a move
that dazzled the soldiers and gave him heroic proportions. You must also
appreciate the importance of stage entrances and exits. When Cleopatra
first met Caesar in Egypt, she arrived rolled up in a carpet, which she
arranged to have unfurled at his feet. George Washington twice left power
with flourish and fanfare (first as a general, then as a president who refused
to sit for a third term), showing he knew how to make the moment count,
dramatically and symbolically. Your own entrances and exits should be
crafied and planned as carefully.
Remember that overacting can be counte1productive—it is another
way of spending too much effort trying to attract attention. The actor
Richard Burton discovered early in his career that by standing totally still
onstage, he drew attention to himself and away from the other actors. It is
less what you do that matters, clearly, than how you do it—your graceful-

imposing stillness on the social stage count for more than overdo»

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11
For several years Cesare Borgia campaigned to gain control of large parts
of Italy in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. In the year I500 he

managed to take Romagna, in northern Italy. The region had for years
been ruled by a series of greedy masters who had plundered its wealth for
themselves. Without police or any disciplining force, it had descended into

lawlessness, whole areas being ruled by robbers and feuding families.
To establish order, Cesare appointed a lieutenant general of the region-—
Remixro

de Oreo, “a cruel and vigorous man,” according to Niccolo

Machiavelli. Cesare gave the Orco absolute powers.
With energy and violence, de Orco established a severe, brutal justice
in Rornagna, and soon rid it of almost all of its lawless elements. But in his

zeal he sometimes went too far, and after a couple of years the local population resented and even hated him. In December of 1502, Cesare took dc»
cisive action. He first let it be known that he had not approved of de Orco’s

cruel and violent deeds, which stemmed from the lieutenanfs brutal nature. Then, on December 22, he

imprisoned cle Drco in the town of Ce-

sena, and the day after Christmas the townspeople awoke to find a strange

spectacle in the middle of the piazza: do Orco’s headless body, dressed in a
lavish suit with a purple cape, the head impaled beside it on a pike, the

bloody knife and executioner’s block laid out beside the head. As Machiavelli concluded his comments on the affair, “The ferocity of this scene left
the people at once stunned and satisfied.”
Interpretation
Cesare Borgia was a master player in the game of power. Always planning
several moves ahead, he set his opponents the cleverest traps. For this
Machiavelli honored him above all others in The Prince.
202

LAW 20

Cesare foresaw the future with amazing clarity in Romagna‘. Only brutal justice would bring order to the region. The process would take several

years, and at first the people would welcome it. But it would soon make
many enemies, and the citizens would come to resent the imposition of
such

unforgiving justice, especially by outsiders. Cesare himself, then,

could not be seen as the agent of this justice-—the people’s hatred would
many problems in the future. And so he chose the one man who
could do the dirty work, knowing in advance that once the task was done
cause too

he would have to display de Orco’s head on a pike. The scapegoat in this
case had been

planned from the beginning.

With Ts’ao Ts’ao, the scapegoat was an entirely innocent man; in the

Romagna, he was the offensive weapon in Cesare’s arsenal that let him get
the dirty work done without bloodying his own hands. With this second
kind of scapegoat it is wise to separate yourself from the hatchet man at
some point, either leaving him
dangling in the wind or, like Cesare, even
making yourself the one to bring him to justice. Not only are you free of involvement in the problem, you can appear as the one who cleaned it up.
The Athenians regularly maintained a number of degraded and useless

A

The Golden Bough. Sirjames Gemge Frazer, 1854-19-71

KEYS TO POWER

The use of scapegoats is as old as civilization itself, and examples of it can
be found in cultures around the world. The main idea behind these sacri-

fices is the shifting of guilt and sin to an outside fig'ure—object, animal, or
man—which is then banished or destroyed. The Hebrews used to take a
live goat (hence the term “scapegoat”) upon whose head the priest would

lay both hands while confessing the sins of the Children of Israel. Having
thus had those sins transferred to it, the beast would be led away and aban-

doned in the wilderness. With the Athenians and the Aztecs, the scapegoat

human, often a person fed and raised for the purpose. Since famine
and plague were thought to be visited on humans by the gods, in punish‘
was

ment for

wrongdoing, the people suffered not only from the famine and

plague themselves but from blame and guilt. They freed themselves of guilt

by transferring it to an innocent person, whose death was intended to satisfy the divine powers and banish the evil from their midst.
It is an extremely human response to not look inward after a mistake
or

crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and guilt on a con-

venient object. When the plague was

ravaging Thebes, Oedipus looked

everywhere for its cause, everywhere except inside himself and his own sin
of incest, which had so offended the gods and occasioned the plague. This

profound need to exteriorize one’s guilt, to project it on another person or
object, has an immense power, which the clever know how to harness. SarLAW 26

203

rifice is a ritual, perhaps the most ancient ritual of all; ritual too is a wellspring of power. In the killing of de Orco, note Cesa.re’s symbolic and ritualistic display of his body. By framing it in this dramatic way he focused

guilt outward The citizens of Romagna responded instantly. Because it
comes so naturally to us to look outward rather than inward, we readily ac~
cept the scapegoat’s guilt.
The bloody sacrifice of the scapegoat seems a barbaric relic of the
past, but the practice lives on to this day, if indirectly and symbolically;
since power depends on appearances, and those in power must seem never
to make mistakes, the use of scapegoats is as popular as ever. What modern
leader will take responsibility for his blunders? He searches out others
to blame, a scapegoat to sacrifice. When Mao Tse-tung’s Cultural Rev—
olution failed miserably, he made no apologies or excuses to the Chinese
people; instead, like Ts’ao Ts’ao before him, he offered up scapegoats, in»
cluding his own personal secretary and higlrranking member of the Party,
Ch ’en Po-ta.
Franklin D. Roosevelt had a reputation for honesty and fairness.
Throughout his career, however, he faced many situations in which being
the nice guy would have spelled political d.isaster—yet he could not be
seen as the
agent of any foul play. For twenty years, then, his secretary,
Louis Howe, played the role de Orco had. He handled the backroom deals,
the manipulation of the press, the underhandecl campaign maneuvers. And
whenever a mistake was committed, or a dirty trick contradicting Roosevelt’s carefully crafted image became public, Howe served as the scapegoat, and never complained.
Besides conveniently shifting blame, a scapegoat can serve as a warnto
others. In 1631 a plot was hatched to oust France’s Cardinal Richeing
lieu from power, a plot that became known as “The Day of the Dupes.” It

almost succeeded, since it involved the upper echelons of government, in«

cluding the queen mother. But through luck and his own connivances,
Richelieu survived.
One of the key conspirators was a man named Marillac, the keeper of
the seals. Richelieu could not imprison him without implicating the queen

mother, an extremely dangerous tactic, so he targeted Marillac’s brother, a
marshal in the army. This man had no involvement in the plot. Richelieu,
however, afraid that other conspiracies might be in the air, especially in the
army, decided to set an example. He tried the brother on trurnped«up
charges and had him executed. In this way he indirectly punished the real

perpetrator, who had thought himself protected, and warned any future
conspirators that he would not shrink from sacrificing the innocent to protect his own power.

'

In fact it is often wise to choose the most innocent victim possible as a
sacrificial goat. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight you, and

their naive protests may be seen as protesting too much—may be seen, in
other words, as a sign of their guilt. Be careful, however, not to create a

martyr. It is important that ytm remain the victim, the poor leader betrayed

by the incompetence of those around you. If the scapegoat appears too
weak and his punishment too cruel, you may end up the victim of your
own device. Sometimes
you should find a more powerful scapegoatm-one
who will elicit less sympathy in the long run.
In this vein, history has time and again shown the value of using a
close associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the “fall of the favorite.”
Most kings had a personal favorite at court, a man whom they singled out,
sometimes for no apparent reason, and lavished with favors and attention.

But this court favorite could serve as at convenient scapegoat in case of a
threat to the king’s reputation. The public would readily believe in the

scapegoat’s guilt-—why would the king sacrifice his favorite unless he were
guilty? And the other couxtiers, resendul of the favorite anyway, would rejoice at his downfall. The king, meanwhile, would rid himself of a man who
by that time had probably learned too much about him, perhaps becoming
arrogant and even disdainful of him. Choosing a close associate as a scapegoat has the same value as the “fall of the favorite.” You may lose a friend
or aide, but in the
long—term scheme of things, it is more important to hide
than
to hold on to someone who one day will probably turn
mistakes
your
against you. Besides, you can always find a. new favorite to take his place.

In 51 B.C. Ptolemy died, leaving four remaining children as heirs. As

the tradition in Egypt, the eldest son, Ptolemy XIII (only ten at the
time), married the elder sister, Cleopatra (now eighteen), and the couple
took the throne together as king and queen. None of the four children felt
satisfied with this; everyone, including Cleopatra, wanted more power. A
struggle emerged between Cleopatra and Ptolemy, earl: trying to push the
was

other to the side.
In 48 15.0., with the help of a government faction that feared Cleopa-

tra’s ambitions, Ptolemy was able to force his sister to flee the country,

leaving himself as sole ruler. In exile, Cleopatra schemed. She wanted to
rule alone and to restore Egypt to its past glory, a goal she felt none of her
other siblings could achieve; yet as long as they were alive, she could not
realize her dream. And the example of Berenice had made it clear that no
one would serve a
queen who was seen murdering her own kind. Even
XIII
had
not
dared murder Cleopatra, although he knew she
Ptolemy
would plot against him from abroad.
Within a year after Cleopatra’s banishment, the Roman dictator Julius
Caesar arrived in Egypt, determined to make the country a Roman colony.
Cleopatra saw her chance: Reentering Egypt in disguise, she traveled hundreds of miles to reach Caesar in Alexandria. Legend has it that she had

herself smuggled into his presence rolled up inside a carpet, which was

gracefully unfurled at his feet, revealing the young queen. Cleopatra imme
diately went to work on the Roman. She appealed to his love of spectacle
and his interest in Egyptian history, and poured on her feminine charms.
Caesar soon succumbed and restored Cleopatra to the throne.
Cleopatra’s siblings seethed—she had outrnaneuvered them. Ptolemy
XIII would not wait to see what happened next: From his palace in
Alexandria, he summoned a great army to march on the city and attack
Caesar. In response, Caesar immediately put Ptolemy and the rest of the

family under house arrest. But Cleopatra’s younger sister Arsinoe escaped
from the palace and placed herself at the head of the approaching Egyptian
troops, proclaiming herself queen of Egypt. Now Cleopatra finally saw her
chance: She convinced Caesar to release Ptolemy from house arrest, under

do the opposite—that he would fight Arsinoe for control of the Egyptian

lings in battle.
Reinforced by troops from Rome, Caesar swiftly defeated the rebels.
In the Egyptians’ retreat, Ptolemy drowned in the Nile. Caesar captured

Antony, the same tactics she had used so well on Julius Caesar. After seducing him, she hinted to him that her sister Arsinoe, still a prisoner in
Rome, had conspired to destroy him. Marc Antony believed her and
promptly had Arsinoe executed, thereby getting rid of the last of the sib
lings who had posed such a threat to Cleopatra.

Legend has it that Cleopatra succeeded through her seductive charms, but
in reality her power came from an ability to get people to do her bidding
without realizing they were being manipulated. Caesar and Antony not

they decimated all of her enemies, in both the government and the military. The two men became her cat’s—paws. They entered the fire for her,
did the ugly butnecessary work, while shielding her from appearing as the
destroyer of herlsiblings and fellow Egyptians. And in the end, both men
acquiesced to herldesire to rule Egypt not as a Roman colony but as an independent allied kingdom. And they did all this for her without realizing
how she had manipulated them. This was persuasion of the subtlest and
most powerful kind.

planned one last offensive to wipe them out, but he was caught in a mutiny:
His own soldiers captured him and turned him over to the Communists.
Now he could only expect the worst.
Meanwhile, however, the Japanese began an invasion of China, and
much to Chiang’s surprise, instead of killing him the Communist leader,
Mao Tse~tung, proposed a deal: The Communists would let him go, and
would recognize him as commander of their forces as well as his, if he
would agree to fight alongside them against their common enemy. Chiang
had expected torture and execution; now he could not believe his luck.
How soit these Reds had become. Without having to fight a rearguard action against the Communists, he knew he could beat the Japanese, and
then a few years down the line he would turn around and destroy the Reds
with ease, He had nothing to lose and everything to gain by agreeing to
their terms.
The Communists proceeded to fight the Japanese in their usual fash~

ion, with hit»and-run guerrilla tactics, while the Nationalists fought a more
conventional war. Together, alter several years, they succeeded in evicting
the Japanese. Now, however, Chiang finally understood what Mao had re-

ally planned. His own army had met the bnmt of the Japanese artillery,
was
greatly weakened, and would take a few years to recover. The Com~
munists, meanwhile, had not only avoided any direct hits from the japa~
nese, they had used the time to recoup their strength, and to spread out

and gain pockets of influence all over China. As soon as the war against the

Japanese ended, the civil war started aga.in—but this time the Communists

enveloped the weakened Nationalists and slowly beat them into submission. The Japanese had served as Mao’s cat’s-paw, inadvertently ploughing

Interpretation
Most leaders who had taken as powerful an enemy as Chiang Kai-shek
prisoner would have made sure to kill him. But in doing so they would
have lost the chance Mao exploited. Without the experienced Chiang as
leader of the Nationalists, the fight to drive the Japanese out might have
lasted much longer, with devastating results. Mao was far too clever to let
anger spoil the chance to kill two birds with one stone. In essence, Mao
used two cat’s-paws to help him attain total victory. First, he cleverly baited

Chiang into taking charge of the war against the Japanese. Mao knew the
Nationalists led by Chiang would do most of the hard fighting and would
succeed in pushing the Japanese out of China, if they did not have to concern themselves with
fighting the Communists at the same time. The Nawere
the first cat’s—paw, used to evict the Japanese. But
tionalists, then,
Mao also knew that in the process of leading the war against the invaders,
the Japanese artillery and air support would decimate the conventional
forces of the Nationalists, doing damage it could take the Communists
decades to inflict. Why waste time and lives if the Japanese could do the
job quickly? It was this wise policy of using one cat’s—paw after another that
allowed the Communists to prevail.
There are two uses of the cat’s—paw: to save appearances, as Cleopatra
did, and to save energy and effort. The latter case in particular demands
that you plan several moves in advance, realizing that a temporary move
backward (letting Chiang go, say) can lead to a giant leap forward. If you
are temporarily weakened and need time to recover, it will often serve you
well to use those around you both as a screen to hide your intentions and

cat’s~paw to do your work for you. Look for a powerful third party who
shares an enemy with you (if for different reasons), then take advantage of

as a

their superior power to deal blows which would have cost you much more
energy, since you are weaker. You can even gently guide them into hostilities. Always search out the overly aggressive as potential cat’s-paws—they
are often more

than willing to get into a fight, and you can choose just the

right fight for your purposes.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW III

Kuriyama Daizen was an adept of Cha-no—yu (Hot Water for Tea, the
Japanese tea ceremony) and a student of the teachings of the great tea master Sen no Rikyu. Around 1620 Daizen learned that a friend of his,
Hoshino Soemon, had borrowed a large sum of money (300 ryo) to help a

relative who had fallen into debt. But although Soemon had managed to
bail out his relative, he had simply displaced the burden onto himself.
Daizen knew Soemon well—-he neither cared not understood much about

money, and could easily get into trouble through slowness in repaying the
loan, which had been made by it wealthy merchant called Kawachiya
Sanemon. Yet if Daizen offered to help Soemon pay back the loam, he
would refuse, out of pride, and might even be offended.
One day Daizen visited his friend, and after touring the garden and
looking at Soemon’s prized peonies, they retired to his reception room.
Here Daizen saw a painting by the master Kano Tennyu. “Ah,” Daizen exI don’t know when I have seen

At first Daizen refused, but when Soemon insisted he gave in. The

day Soemon in turn received a package from Daizen. Inside it was a
beautiful and delicate vase, which Daizen, in an accompanying note, asked

possess it. “I hear,” Daizen continued, “he has a fine piece of fancy paper
[the 3()()~ryo I.O.U.] which you would much like. It is possible you might
arrange an exchange.”
Realizing what his gracious friend was up to, Soemon took the vase to

Interpretation
Kuriyama Daizen understood that the granting of a favor is never simple:
If it is done withfuss and obviousness, its receiver feels burdened by an
obligation. This may give the door a certain power, but it is a power that
will eventually self-destruct, for it will stir up resentment and resistance. A
favor done indirectly and elegantly has ten times more power. Daizen
knew a direct approach would only have offended Soemon. By letting his

the encounter feeling fulfilled in their own way.

In essence, Daizen made himself the cat’s-paw, the tool to take the

chestnuts out of the fire. He must have felt some pain in losing the vase, but

he gained not only the painting but, more important, the power of the
courtier. The courtier uses his gloved hand to soften any blows against him,

disguise his scars, and make the act of rescue more elegant and clean. By
helping others, the courtier eventually helps himself. Daizen’s example
provides the paradigm for every favor done between friends and peers:

impose your favors. Search out ways to make yourself the cat’s—paw,

KEYS TO POWER
As a leader you may imagine that constant diligence, and the appearance

of working harder than anyone else, signify power. Actually, though, they
have the opposite effect: They imply weakness. Why are you working so
hard? Perhaps you are incompetent, and have to put in extra effort just to

keep up; perhaps you are one of those people who does not know how to
delegate, and has to meddle in everything. The truly powerful, on the other
hand, seem never to be in a hurry or overburdened. While others work
their fingers to the bone, they take their leisure. They know how to find the
right people to put in the effort while they save their energy and keep their
hands out of the fire. Similarly, you may believe that by taking on the dirty
work yourself, involving yourself directly in unpleasant actions, you impose your power and instill fear. In fact you make yourself look ugly, and
abusive of your high position. Truly powerful people keep their hands
clean. Only good things surround them, and the only announcements they
make are of glorious achievements.

strategy is the ability to think far ahead, to imagine ways in which other

people can be baited into doing the job for you.
An essential element in making this strategy work is to disguise your
goal, shrouding it in mystery, like the strange enemy boats appearing
dimly in the mist. When your rivals cannot be sure what you are after, they
will reaxzt in ways that often work against them in the long run. In fact they
will become your ca3.’s-paws. If you disguise your intentions, it is much easier to guide them into moves that accomplish exactly what you want done,
but prefer not to do yourself. This may require planning several moves in
advance, like a billiard ball that bounces off the sides a few times before

The early-twentieth-century American con artist Yellow Kid Weil

Convinced the

invest, this man would increase the size of the pot. making bigger bucks for
all concerned. The cat‘s-paw would then involve the wealthy sucker who
had been Weil’-s target all along, but who would not suspect a trap, since it

his trusty subordinate who had roped him in. Devices like this are

The easiest and most effective way to use a cat’s-paw is often to plant

guise yourself as the source.

Finally, you may well find cases in which deliberately offering yourself
cat’s-paw will ultimately gain you great power. This is the ruse of the
perfect courtier. Its symbol is Sir Walter Raleigh, who once placed his own
cloak on the muddy ground so that Queen Elizabeth would not sully her
shoes. As the instrument that protects a master or peer from unpleasant
ness or danger,
you gain immense respect, which sooner or later will pay
as the

dividends. And remember: If you can make your assistance subtle and gra—
cious rather than boastful and burdensome, your recompense will be that

much the more satisfying and powerful.

REVERSAI.
The cat’s~paw and the scapegoat must be used with extreme caution and

delicacy. They are like screens that hide your own involvement in dirty
work from the public; if at any moment the screen is lifted and you are
seen as the
manipulator, the puppet master, the whole dynamic aims
around—your hand will be seen everywhere, and you will be blamed for
misfortunes you may have had nothing to do with. Once the truth is re
vealed, events will snowball beyond your control.
In 1572, Queen Catherine de’ Médicis of France conspired to do away
with Gaspard de Coligny, an admiral in the French navy and a leading
member of the Huguenot (French Protestant) community. Coliguy was
close to Catherine’s son, Charles IX, and she feared his growing influence
on the young

king. So she arranged for a member of the Guise family, one

of the most powerful royal clans in France, to assassinate him.

Secretly, however, Catherine had another plan: She Wanted the Huguenots to blame the Guises for killing one of their leaders, and to take re
venge. With one blow, she would erase or injure two threatening rivals,
Coligny and the Guise family. Yet both plans went awry. The assassin
missed his target, only wounding Coligny; knowing Catherine as his
enemy, he strongly suspected it was she who had set up the attack on him,
and he told the king so. Eventually the failed assassination and the arguments that ensued from it set off a chain of events that led to a bloody civil
war between Catholics and Protestants, culminating in the
horrifying Mas
sacre

of St. Bartholomew’s Eve, in which thousands of Protestants were

killed.
If you have to use a cat’s—paw or a scapegoat in an action of great con-

sequence, be very careful: Too much can go wrong. It is often wiser to use
such dupes in more innocent endeavors, where mistakes or miscalculations
will cause no serious harm.

Finally, there are moments when it is advantageous to not disguise
your involvement or responsibility, but rather to take the blame yourself
for some mistake. If you have power and are secure in it, you should some
times play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you ask for forgiveness

from those weaker than you. It is the ploy of the king who makes a show of
his own sacrifices for the good of the people. Similarly, upon occasion you
may want to appear as the agent of punishment in order to instill fear and
trembling in your subordinates. Instead of the ca.t‘s~paw you show your

mighty hand as a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If
you play it too often, fear will turn into resentment and hatred. Before you
know it, such emotions will spark a vigorous opposition that will someday
bring you down. Get in the habit of using a cat’s-paw——it is far safer.

one of the most elfective. Having a large following opens up all sorts of

possibilities for deception; not only will your followers worship you, they
will defend you from your enemies and will voluntarily take on the work of
enticing others to join your fledgling cult. This kind of power will lift you to
another realm: You will no longer have to struggle or use subterfuge to enforce your will. You are adored and can do no wrong.

You might think it a gargantuan task to create such a following, but in

something, anything. This makes us eminently gullible: We simply cannot
endure long periods of doubt, or of the emptiness that comes from a lack of
something to believe in. Dangle in front of us some new cause, elixir, getrich-quick scheme, or the latest technological trend or art movement and
we leap from the water as one to take the bait. Look at
history: The chronicles of the new trends and cults that have made a mass following for themselves could fill a library. After a few centuries, a few decades, a few years,
a few months, they generally look ridiculous, but at the time they seem so

The great European Charlatans of the sixteenth and seventeenth ten»
turies mastered the art of cultmaking. They lived, as we do now, in a time

of transformation: Organized religion was on the wane, science on the rise.

People were desperate to mlly around a new cause or faith. The Charlatans
had begun by peddling health elixirs and alchernic shortcuts to wealth.

Moving quickly from town to town, they originally focused on small
groups—until, by accident, they stumbled on a truth of human nature:
The larger the group they gathered around themselves, the easier it was to
deceive.

spoken to them individually, they might have found him ridiculous, but lost

came

impossible for them to find the distance to be skeptical, Any deficien-

cies in the charlatan’s ideas were hidden by the zeal of the mass. Passion

and enthusiasm swept through the crowd like a contagion, and they reacted

violently to anyone who dared to spread a seed of doubt. Both consciously
studying this dynamic over decades of experiment and spontaneously
adapting to these situations as they happened, the charlatans perfected the
science of attracting and holding a crowd, molding the crowd into followers
and the followers into a cult.

The gimmicks of the Charlatans may seem quaint today, but there are
thousands of charlatans among us still, using the same tried~a:nd—true meth~

day charlatans in all arenas of life-~business, fashion, politics, art. Many of
them, perhaps, are following in the charlatan tradition without having any
knowledge of its history, but you can he more systematic and deliberate.
Simply follow the five steps of cultmaking that our charlatan ancestors per-

The gieut rnasxr of

fected over the years.

Step 1: Keep It Vague; Keep It Simple. To create a cult you must first
attract attention. This you should do not through actions, which are too

clear and readable, but through words, which are hazy and deceptive. Your
initial speeches, conversations, and interviews must include two elements:
on the one

hand the promise of something great and transformative, and

on the other a. total vagueness. This combination will stimulate all kinds of

hazy dreams in your listeners, who will make their own connections and
see what they want to see.
To make your vagueness attractive, use words of great resonance but

cloudy meaning, words full of heat and enthusiasm. Fancy titles for simple
things are helpful, as are the use of numbers and the creation of new words
for vague concepts. All of these create the impression of specialized knowl
edge, giving you a veneer of profunclity. By the same token, try to make the
subject of your cult new and fresh, so that few will understand it. Done right,
the combination of vague promises, cloudy‘ but alluring concepts, and fiery
enthusiasm will stir people’s souls and a group will form around you.
Talk :00 vaguely and you have no credibility. But it is more dangerous
to be specific. If you explain in detail the benefits people will gain by following your cult, you will be expected to satisfy them.
As a corollary to its vagueness your appeal should also be simple.

Step 3: Borrow the Forms of Organized Religion to Structure the
Group. Your cultlike following is growing; it is time to organize it. Find a
way both elevating and comforting. Organized religions have long held unquestioned authority for large numbers of people, and continue to do so in
our
supposedly secular age. And even if the religion itself has faded some,
its forms still resonate with power. The lofty and holy associations of organized religion can be endlessly exploited. Create rituals for your followers;
organize them into a hierarchy, ranking them in grades of sanctity, and giving them names and titles that resound with religious overtones; ask them
for sacrifices that will fill your coffers and increase your power. To emphasize your gathering’s quasireligious nature, talk and act like a prophet. You
are not a dictator, after all; you are a priest, a guru, a sage, a shaman, or any
other word that hides your real power in the mist of religion.
Step 4: Disguise Your Source of Income. Your group has grown, and you
have structured it in a churchlike form. Your coffers are beginning to fill
with your followers’ money. Yet you must never be seen as hungry for
money and the power it brings. It is at this moment that you must disguise
the source of your income.

Your followers want to believe that if they follow you all sorts of good

things will fall into their lap. By surrounding yourself with luxury you become living
proof of the soundness of your belief system. Never reveal that
wealth
actually comes from your followers’ pockets; instead, make it

Step 5: Set Up an Us-Versus—Them Dynamic. The group is new large
and thriving, a magnet attracting more and more particles. If you are not
careful, though, inertia will set in, and time and boredom will demagnetize
the group. To keep your followers united, you must now do what all religions and belief systems have done: create an us—versus—thern dynamic.
First, make sure your followers believe they are part of an exclusive

club, unified by a bond of common goals. Then, to strengthen this bond,
manufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you. There is a
force of nonbelievers that will do anything to stop you. Any outsider who

Observance I
In the year 1653, a twenty»seven-ye-arclcl Milan man named Francesco

Giuseppe Borri claimed to have had a vision. He went around town telling
one and all that the archangel Michael had
appeared to him and announced that he had been chosen to be the mpitano generale of the Army
of the New Pope, an army that would seize and revitalize the world.
The archangel had further revealed that Born‘ now had the power to see
people’s souls, and that he would soon discover the phi1osopher’s stone-a
longsought--after substance that could change base metals into gold.
Friends and acquaintances who heard Borri explain the vision, and who
witnessed the change that had come over him, were impressed, for Born‘
had previously devoted himself to a life of wine, women, and gambling.
Now he gave all that up, plunging himself into the study of alchemy and
talking only of mysticism and the occult.
The transformation was so sudden and miraculous, and Borri’s words
were so

filled with enthusiasm, that he began to create a following. Unfor-

tunately the Italian Inquisition began to notice him as well—they prosecuted anyone who delved into the occult—so he left Italy and began to
wander Europe, from Ausuia to Holland, telling one and all that “to those
who follow me all joy shall be granted.” Wherever Borri stayed he at—
tracted followers. His method was simple: He spoke of his vision, which
had grown more and more elaborate, and offered to “look into” the soul of
anyone who believed him (and they were many). Seemingly in a trance, he
would stare at this new follower for several minutes, then claim to have
seen the

person’s soul, degree of enlightenment, and potential for spiritual

greatness. If what he saw showed promise, he would add the person to his

growing order of disciples, an honor indeed.
The cult had six degrees, into which the disciples were assigned ac-

cording to what Borri had glimpsed in their souls. With work and total de
votion to the cult they could graduate to a higher degree. Borri-—-whom
they called “His Excellency,” and “Universal Doctor”--demanded from
them the strictest vows of poverty. All the goods and moneys they possessed had to be turned over to him. But they did not mind handing over
their property, for Borri had told them, “I shall soon bring my chemical

and by this means we shall all have as much gold as we desire.”

Given his growing wealth, Barri began to change his style of living.
Renting the most splendid apartment in the city into which he had tem-

porarily settled, he would furnish it with fabulous furniture and accessories,
which he had begun to collect. He would drive through the city in a coach
studded with jewels, with six magnificent black horses at its head. He never

stayed too long in one place, and when he disappeared, saying he had
more souls to gather into his flock, his reputation only grew in his absence.
He became famous, although in fact he had never done a single concrete
thing.
From all over Europe, the blind, the crippled, and the desperate came
to visit Borri, for word had
spread that he had healing powers. He asked no
fee for his services, which only made him seem more marvelous, and indeed some claimed that in this or that city he had performed a miracle
cure. By only hinting at his accomplishments, he encouraged people’s
imaginations to blow them up to fantastic proportions. His wealth, for ex~

ample, actually came from the vast sums he was collecting from his increasingly select group of rich disciples; yet it was presumed that he had in
fact perfected the philosopher’s stone. The Church continued to pursue
him, denouncing him for heresy and witchcraft, and Borzi’s response to
these charges was a dignified silence; this only enhanced his reputation and
made his followers more passionate. Only the great are persecuted, after
all; how many understood Jesus Christ in his own time? Born’ did not have
to say a word—-his followers now called the Pope the Antichrist.
And so Borri’s power grew and grew, until one day he left the city of
Amsterdam (where he had settled for a while), absconding with huge sums
of borrowed money and diamonds that had been entrusted to him. (He
claimed to be able to remove the flaws from diamonds through the power
of his gifted mind.) Now he was on the run. The Inquisition eventually
caught up with him, and for the last Menty years of his life he was imprisoned in Rome. But so great was the belief in his occult powers that to his

dying day he was visited by wealthy believers, including Queen Christina
of Sweden. Supplying him udth money and materials, these visitors allowed him to continue his search for the elusive philosopher’s stone.

Interpretation
Before he formed his cult, Borri seems to have stumbled on a critical discovery. Tiring of his life of debauchery, he had decided to give it up and to
devote himself to the occult, a genuine interest of his. He must have no

titted, however, that when he alluded to a mystical experience (rather than

physical exhaustion) as the source of his conversion, people of all classes
wanted to hear more. Realizing the power he could gain by ascxibing the

change to something external and mysterious, he went further with his
manufactured visions. The grander the vision, and the more sacrifices he
asked for, the more appealing and believable his story seemed to become.
Remember: People are not interested in the truth about change. They

do not want to hear that it has come from hard work, or from anything as
banal as exhaustion, boredom, or depression; they are dying to believe in

something romantic, otherworldly. They want to hear of angels and out—of~
body experiences. Indulge them. Hint at the mystical source of some personal change, wrap it in ethereal colors, and a cultlike following will form
around you. Adapt to people’s needs: The messiah must mirror the desires
of his followers. And always mm high. The bigger and bolder your illusion,
the better.

country doctor named Michael Schiippach who practiced a different kind

mrmundml will: nrrorts

of medicine: He used the healing powers of nature to perform miraculous

zm.-1 vials of "ellu:rial

cures.

Soon well-to—do people from all over the Continent, their ailments

both serious and mild, were making the trek to the alpine village of Lang-

Schiippach lived and worked. Trudging through the mountains,
these visitors witnessed the most dramatic natural landscapes that Europe

nau, where

has to offer. By the time they reached Langnau, they were already feeling
transformed and on their way to health.

Schiippach, who had become known as simply the “Mountain Doctor,” had a small pharmacy in town. This place became quite a scene:
Crowds of people from many different countries would cram the small
room, its walls lined with colorful bottles filled with herbal cures. Where
most doctors of the time prescribed foul-tasting concoctions that bore in-

comprehensible Latin titles (as medicines often do still), Schiippaclfs cures
had names such as “The Oil of joy,” “Little Flower’s Heart,” or “Against
the Monster,” and they tasted sweet and pleasing.
Visitors to Langnau would have to wait patiently for a visit with the
Mountain Doctor, because every day some eighty messengers would arrive
at the

pharmacy bearing flasks of urine from all over Europe. Schiippach

claimed he could diagnose what ailed you simply by looking at a sample of
your mine and reading a written description of your ailment. (Naturally he
read the description very carefully before prescribing a cure.) When he fl»
nally had a spare minute (the urine samples took up much of his time), he
would call the visitor into his office in the pharmacy. He would then examine this person’s urine sample, explaining that its appearance would tell

him everything he needed to know. Country people had a sense for these

things, he would say——their wisdom came from living a simple, godly life
with none of the complications of urban living. This personal consultation
would also include a discussion as to how one might bring one’s soul more
into harmony with nature.

Schiippach had devised many forms of treatment, each profoundly un~
like the usual medical practices of the time. He was a believer, for instance,
in electric shock therapy. To those who wondered whether this was in
keeping with his belief in the healing power of nature, he would explain
that electricity is a natural phenomenon; he was merely imitating the

and uther e.rst/rlres.

Over the years, the Mountain Doctor’s fame grew. He was consulted

by the powerful—-—even the writer Goethe made the trek to his village——and
he became the center of a cult of nature in which everything natural was
considered worthy of worship. Schiippach was careful to create effects that
would entertain and inspire his patients. A professor who visited him once
wrote, “One stands or sits in company, one plays cards, sometimes with a
young woman; now a concert is given, now a lunch or supper, and now a
little ballet is presented. With a very happy effect, the freedom of nature is

everywhere united with the pleasures of the beau monde, and if the doctor
is not able to heal any diseases, he can at least cure hypochondria and the
vapors.”
Interpretation
Schiippach had begun his career as an ordinary village doctor. He would
sometimes use in his practice some of the village remedies be had grown
up with, and apparently he noticed some results, for soon these herbal tinctures and natural forms of healing became his specialty. And in fact his nat—
ural form of healing did have profound psychological effects on his
patients. Where the normal drugs of the time created fear and pain, Schiip—
pach’s treatments were comfortable and soothing. The resulting unprovement in the patients mood was a critical element in the cures he brought
about. His patients believed so deeply in his skills that they willed themselves into health. Instead of scoffing at their irrational explanations for
their ailments, Schiippach used their hypochondria to make it seem that he
had effected a great cure.
The caseof the Mountain Doctor teaches us valuable lessons in the
creation of a cultlike following. First, you must End a. way to engage peo-

ple’s will, to make their belief in your powers strong enough that they
imagine all sorts of benefits. Their belief will have a self—fullilling quality,
but you must make sure that it is you, rather than their own will, who is
seen as the

agent of nransformaiion. Find the belief, cause, or fantasy that

will make them believe with a passion and they will imagine the rest, wor«

shipping you as healer, prophet, genius, whatever you like.
Second, Schlippach teaches us the everlasting power of belief in nature, and in simplicity. Nature, in reality, is full of much that is terrifyingpoisonous plants, fierce animals, sudden disasters, plagues. Belief in the

complicated and stressful times.
This appeal, however, must be handled right. Devise a kind of theater
of nature in which you, as the director, pick and choose the qualities that lit
the romanticism of the times. The Mountain Doctor played the part to per-

fection, playing up his homespun wisdom and wit, and staging his cures as
dramatic pieces. He did not make himself one with nature; instead he

Observance III
In 1788, at the age of fifty-five, the doctor and scientist Franz Mesmer was
at a crossroads. He was a pioneer in the

study of animal magnetism-the
belief that animals contain magnetic matter, and that a doctor or specialist
can effect miraculous cures by working on this charged substam:e—but in
Vienna, where he lived, his theories had met with scorn and ridicule from
the medical establishment. In treating women for convulsions, Mesmer
claimed to have worked a number of cures, his proudest achievement

being the restoration of sight to a blind girl. But. another doctor who examined the young girl said she was as blind as ever, an assessment with which
she herself agreed. Mesmer countered that his enemies were out to slander
him by winning her over to their side. This claim only elicited more
ridicule. Clearly the sober-minded Viennese were the wrong audience for
his theories, and so he decided to move to Paris and start again.

Renting a splendid apartment in his new city, Mesmer decorated it ap~
propriately. Stained glass in most of the windows created a religious feeling, and mirrors on all the walls produced an hypnotic effect The doctor
advertised that in his apartment he would give demonstrations of the powers of animal
magnetism, inviting the diseased and melancholic to feel its

Within months of his arrival in Paris, Mesmer became the rage. His

supporters included Marie—Antoinette herself, the queen of France, wife of
Louis XVI. As in Vienna, he was condemned by the official faculty of medicine, but it did not matter. His growing following of pupils and patients

paid him handsomely.
Mesmer expanded his theories to proclaim that all humanity could be
brought into harmony through the power of magnetism, a concept with
much appeal during the French Revolution. A cult of Mesrnerism spread
across the
country; in many towns, “Societies of Harmony” sprang up to
experiment with magnetism. These societies eventually became notorious:

At the height of Mesmer‘s popularity, a French commission published

report based on years of testing the theory of animal magnetism. The
conclusion: Magneu'sm’s effects on the body actually came from a kind of
a

group hysteria and autosuggestion. The report was well documented, and
mined Mesmer’s reputation in France. He left the country and went into
retirement. Only a few years later, however, imitators sprang up all over

Europe and the cult of Mesmerism spread once again, its believers more
numerous than ever.

Interpretation
Mesmer’s career can be broken into two parts. When still in Vienna, he

clearly believed in the validity of his theory, and did all he could to prove
it. But his growing frustration and the disapproval of his colleagues made
him adopt another strategy. First he moved to Paris, where no one knew
him, and where his extravagant theories found a more fruitful soil. Then he
appealed to the French love of theater and spectacle, making his apartment
into a kind of magical world in which a sensory overload of smells, sights,
and sounds entranced his customers. Most important, from now on he

practiced his magnetism only on a group. The group provided the setting
in which the magnetism would have its proper effect, one believer infecting
the other, overwhelming any individual doubter.
Mesmer thus passed from being a confirmed advocate of magnetism
tn the role of a charlatan using every trick in the book to captivate the pub-

lie. The biggest trick of all was to play on the repressed sexuality that bubbles under the surface of any group setting. In a group, a longing for social

unity, a longing older than civilization, cries out to be awakened. This de~
sire may be subsumed under a unifying cause, but beneath it is a repressed

sexuality that the charlatan knows how to exploit and manipulate for his
own

purposes.
This is the lesson that Mesmer teaches us: Our tendency to doubt, the

distance that allows us to reason, is broken down when we join a group.
The warmth and infectiousness of the group overwhelm the skeptical individual. This is the power you gain by creating a cult. Also, by playing on

people’s repressed sexuality, you lead them into mistaking their excited
feelings for signs of your mystical strength. You gain untold power by
working on people’s unrealized desire for a. kind of promiscuous and
pagan unity.
Remember too that the most effective cults mix religion with science.
Take the latest technological trend or fad and blend it with a noble cause, a

mystical faith, a new form of healing. People’s interpretations of your hy—
brid cult will run rampant, and they will attribute powers to you that you
had never even thought to claim.

have Clustered around you, no power can wrest them away.

Authority: The charlatan achieves his great power by simply opening
a
possibility for men to believe what they already want to believe.
The credulous cannot keep at a distance; they crowd around the
wonder worker, entering his personal aura, surrendering themselves
to illusion with a heavy solemnity, like cattle. (Grete de Francesco)

R EVE RSAL

One reason to create a following is that a group is often easier to deceive
than an individual, and turns over to you that much more power. This
comes, however, with a danger: If at any moment the group sees through

you, you will find yourself facing not one deceived Soul but an angry crowd
that will tear you to pieces as avidly as it once followed you. The Charlatans

constantly faced this danger, and were always ready to move out of town as
it inevitably became clear that their elixirs did not work and their ideas
were sham. Too slow and
they paid with their lives. In playing with the
crowd, you are playing with fire, and must constantly keep an eye out for
any sparks of doubt, any enemies who will turn the crowd against you.
When you play with the emotions of a crowd, you have to know how to
adapt, attuning yourself instantaneously to all of the moods and desires that
a
group will produce. Use spies, be on top of everything, and keep your
bags packed.
For this reason you may often prefer to deal with people one by one.
Isolating them from their normal milieu can have the same effect as putting
them in a group—it makes them more prone to suggestion and intimidation. Choose the right sucker and if he eventually sees through you he may

prove easier to escape than a crowd.

in a time of a fiscal crisis, the government would have to spend millions to

fix it. Many Parlsians considered the Eiffel Tower an eyesore and would be

delighted to see it go. Over time, even the tourists would forget about it—it
would live on in photographs and postcards. “Gentlemen,” Lustig said,
“you are all invited to make the government an offer for the Eiffel Tower.”
He gave the businessmen sheets of government stationery filled with

figures, such as the tonnage of the tower’s metal. Their eyes popped as they
calculated how much they could make from the scrap. Then Lustig led
them to a waiting limo, which brought them to the Eiffel Tower. Flashing

Several days after the offers were submitted, one of the five, a Monsieur P., received notice that his bid was the winner, and that to secure the

sale he should come to the suite at the hotel within two days, bearing a certified check for more than 250,000 francs (the equivalent today of about

$1,000,000)--—a quarter of the total price. On delivery of the check, he
would receive the documents confirming his ownership of the Eiffel Tower.
Monsieur P. was excited—-he would go down in history as the man who
had bought and torn down the infamous landmark. But by the time he arrived at the suite, check in hand, he was beginning to have doubts about
the whole affair. Why meet in a hotel instead of a government building?
Why hadrft he heard from other offieials? Was this a hoax, a scam? As he
listened to Lustig discuss the arrangements for the scrapping of the tower,

Interpretation
Had Count Victor Lustig, con artist extraordinaire, tried to sell the Arc de

Triomphe, a bridge over the Seine, a statue of Balzac, no one would have
believed him. But the Eiffel Tower was just too large, too improbable to be
part of a con job. In fact it was so improbable that Lustig was able to return
to Paris six months later and “resell” the Eiffel Tower to a different scrap-

iron dealer, and for a higher price-—a sum in francs equivalent today to

$1,500,000!
Largeness of scale deceives the human eye. It distracts and awes us,
and is so self-evident that we carmot imagine there is any illusion or deception afoot. Arm yourself with bigness and boldness—stretch your decepover

tions as far as they will go and then go further. If you sense that the sucker
has suspicions, do as the intrepid Lustig did: Instead of backing down, or

lowering his price, he simply raised his price higher, by asking for and getting a bribe. Asking for more puts the other person on the defensive, cuts
out the nibbling effect of compromise and doubt, and overwhelms with its
boldness.

fearsome boyar clan. The Shuisky princes seized control of the government and threw Obolensky in prison, where he starved to death. At the age
of eight, Ivan was now a despised orphan, and any boyar or family member who took an interest in him was immediately banished or killed.
And so Ivan roamed the palace, hungry, ill clothed, and often in bid
the Shuiskys, who treated him roughly when they saw him. On
from
ing
some days they would search him out, clothe him in royal robes, hand him
a. scepter, and set him on the throne——a kind of mock ritual in which they
lampooned his royal pretensions. Then they would shoo him away. One
evening several of them chased the Metropolitan———the head of the Russian
chu;rch—through the palace, and he sought refuge in Ivan’s room; the boy
watched in horror as the Shuiskys entered, hurled insults, and beat the
Metropolitan mercilessly.
Ivan had one friend in the palace, a boyar named Vorontsov who con»
soled and advised him. One day, however, as he, Vorontsov, and the

Metropolitan conferred in the palace refectory, several Shuiskys
burst in, heat up Vorontsov, and insulted the Metropolitan by hearing and
treading on his robes. Then they banished Vorontsov from Moscow.
Throughout all this Ivan maintained a strict silence. To the boyars it
seemed that their plan had worked: The young man had turned into a terrified and obedient idiot. They could ignore him now, even leave him
newest

alone. But on the evening of December 29, I543, Ivan, now thirteen, asked
Prince Andrei Shuisky to come to his room. When the prince arrived, the
room was filled with

palace guards. Young Ivan then pointed his finger at

Andrei and ordered the guards to arrest him, have him killed, and throw
his body to the bloodhounds in the royal kennel. Over the next few days

Interpretation
The world is full of boyars--men who despise you, fear your ambition, and

jealously guard their shrinking realms of power. You need to establish your
authority and gain respect, but the moment the boyars sense your growing
boldness, they will act to thwart you. This is how Ivan met such a situation:
He lay low, showing neither ambition nor discontent. He waited, and when
the time came he brought the palace guards over to his side. The guards
had come to hate the cruel Shuiskys. Once they agreed to Ivan’s plan, he

On and on the anonymous pamphlet went, sparing none of the great

Interpretation
With one short pamphlet, Aretino, son of a poor shoemaker and a servant

himself, hurled himself to fame. Everyone in Rome rushed to find out who
this daring young man was. Even the pope, amused by his audacity, sought
him out and ended up giving him a job in the papal service. Over the years
he came to be known as the “Scourge of Princes,” and his biting tongue
earned him the respect and fear of the great, from the king of France to the

Hapsburg emperor.
The Aretino strategy is simple: When you are as small and obscure as
David was, you must find a Goliath to attack. The larger the target, the

through effrontery. Casanova’s boldness was not revealed in a daring approach to the woman he desired, or in intrepid words to flatter her; it consisted in his ability to surrender himself to her completely and to make her
believe he would do anything for her, even risk his life, which in fact he
sometimes did. The woman on whom he lavished this attention under-

stood that he held nothing back from her. This was infinitely more flatter-

ing than compliments. At no point during the seduction would he show
hesitation or doubt, simply because he never felt it.
Part of the charm of being seduced is that it makes us feel engulfed,

temporarily outside of ourselves and the usual doubts that permeate our
lives. The moment the seducer hesitates, the charm is broken, because we

become aware of the process, of their deliberate effort to seduce us, of
their self-consciousness. Boldness directs attention outward and

keeps

the illusion alive. It never induces awkwardness or embarrassment. And
so we

admire the bold, and prefer to be around them, because their self-

confidence infects us and draws us outside our own realm of inwardness
and reflection.
Few are born bold. Even Napoleon had to cultivate the habit on the

battlefield, where he knew it was a matter of life and death. In social set
tings he was awkward and timid, but he overcame this and practiced boldness in every

part of his life because he saw its tremendous power, how it

could literally enlarge it man (even one who, like Napoleon, was in fact

conspicuously small). We also see this change in Ivan the Terrible: A harmless boy suddenly transforms himself into a powerful young man who commands authority, simply by pointing a finger and taking hold action.
You must practice and develop your boldness. You will often find uses
for it. The best place to begin is often the delicate world of negotiation, par-

How ofien we put ourselves down by asking for too little. When Christa
pher Columbus proposed that the Spanish court finance his voyage to the
Americas, he also made the insanely bold demand that he be called
“Grand Admiral of the Ocean.” The court agreed. The price he set was the
price he received--he demanded to be treated with respect, and so he was.

Henry Kissinger too knew that in negotiation, bold demands work better
than starting off with piecemeal concessions and trying to meet the other
person halfway. Set your value high, and then, as Count Lusfig did, set it
higher.

Authority: I certainly think that it is better to be impetuous than
cautious, for fortune is a woman, and it is necessary, if you wish to
master her, to conquer her by force; and it can be seen that she lets
herself be overcome by the bold rather than by those who proceed

coldly. And therefore, like a woman, she is always a friend to
the young, because they are less cautious, fiercer, and master
her with greater audacity. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

LAW 2 B

REVE RS/\L
Boldness should never be the strategy behind all of your actions. It is a tactical instrument, to be used at the right moment. Plan and think ahead, and
make the final element the bold move that will bring you success. In other

words, since boldness is a learned response, it is also one that you leam to
control and utilize at will. To go through life armed only with audacity
would be tiring and also fatal. You would offend too many people, as is
proven by those who cannot control their boldness, One such person was
Lola Montez; her audacity brought her triumphs and led to her seduction
of the king of Baxfatia. But since she could never rein in her boldness, it

also led to her downfall—-in Bavaria, in England, wherever she turned. It
crossed the border between boldness and the appearance of cruelty, even

insanity. Ivan the Terrible suffered the same fate: When the power of boldness brought him success, he stuck to it, to the point where it became a life

long pattern of violence and sadism. He lost the ability to tell when
boldness was appropriate and when it was not.

Timidity has no place in the realm of power; you will often benefit,
however, by being able to feign it. At that point, of course, it is no longer
iimidity but an offensive weapon: You are luring people in with your show
of shyness, all the better to pounce on them boldly later.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In 1510 a ship set out from the island of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the
Dominican Republic) for Venezuela, where it was to rescue a besieged

Spanish colony. Several miles out of port, a stowaway climbed out of a
provision chest: Vasco N ufiez de Balboa, a noble Spaniard who had come
to the New World in search of gold but had fallen into debt and had estaped his creditors by hiding in the chest.
Balboa had been obsessed with gold ever since Columbus had returned to Spain from his voyages with tales of a fabulous but as yet undiscovered kingdom called El Dorado. Balboa was one of the first
adventurers to come in search of Colurnbus’s land of gold, and he had decided from the beginning that he would be the one to find it, through
sheer audacity and single—mindedness. Now that he was free of his creditors, nothing would stop him.
Unfortunately the ship’s owner, a wealthy jurist named Francisco Fernandez de Enciso, was furious when told of the stowaway, and he ordered
that Balboa be left on the first island they came across. Before they found
any island, however, Enciso received news that the colony he was to rescue had been abandoned. This was Balboa’s chance. He told the sailors of

his previous voyages to Panarna, and of the rumors he had heard of gold
in the area. The excited sailors convinced Enciso to spare Balboa’s life,

and to establish a colony in Panama. Weeks later they named their new

settlement “Darien.”
Darien’s first governor was Enciso, but Balboa was not a man to let
others steal the initiative. He

Enciso fled to Spain, fearing for his life. Months later, when a representative of the Spanish crown arrived to establish himself as the new, official
governor of Darien, he was turned away. On his return voyage to Spain,
this man drowned; the drowning was accidental, but under Spanish law,
Balboa had murdered the governor and usurped his position.
Balb0a’s bravado had got him out of scrapes before, but now his

hopes of wealth and glory seemed doomed. To lay claim to El Dorado,
should he discover it, he would need the approval of the Spanish king-—
which, as an outlaw, he would never receive. There was only one solution.
Panamanian Indians had told Balboa of a vast ocean on the other side of
the Central American isthmus, and had said diat by traveling south upon

this western coast, he would reach a fabulous land of gold, called by a

the treacherous jungles of Panama and become the first European to bathe
his feet in this new ocean. From there he would march on El Dorado. If he

did this on Spain’s behalf, he would obtain the eternal gratitude of the

king, and would secure his own reprieve—-only he had to act before Spanish authorities came to arrest him.

mained, many having succumbed to the harsh conditions——the bloodsucking insects, the torrential rainfall, fever. Finally, from a mountaintop,
Balboa became the first European to lay eyes on the Pacific Ocean. Days
later he marched in his armor into its waters, bearing the banner of Castile

and claiming all its seas, lands, and islands in the name of the Spanish
throne.
Indians from the area greeted Balboa with gold, jewels, and precious

pearls, the like of which he had never seen. When he asked where these
had come from, the Indians pointed south, to the land of the Incas. But
Balboa had only a few soldiers left. For the moment, he decided, he

should return to Darien, send the jewels and gold to Spain as a token
of good will, and ask for a large army to aid him in the conquest of El

Dorado.

All the same, Balboa felt uneasy. Gold was his dream, El Dorado his

only desire. In pursuit of this goal he had nearly died many times over,
and to share the wealth and glory with a newcomer would be intolerable.
He also soon discovered that Pedraxias was a jealous, bitter man, and
equally unhappy with the situation. Once again, the only solution for Bel»

larger army, carrying shipbuilding materials and tools. Once on the Pa—

Surprisingly enough, Pedrarias agreed to the plan—--perhaps sensing it
would never work. Hundreds died in this second march through the jun-

gle, and the timber they carried rotted in the torrential rains. Balboa, as
usual, was undaunted»-no power in the world could thwart his plan—and
on arriving at the Pacific he began to cut down trees for new lumber. But
the men remaining to him were too few and too weak to mount an invasion, and once again Balboa had to return to Darien.

LAW 29

Interpretation

miuwarr:

Most men are ruled by the heart, not the head. Their plans are vague, and
when they meet obstacles they improvise. But improvisation will only

bring you as far as the next crisis, and is never a substitute for thinking
several steps ahead and planning to the end.
Balboa had a dream of glory and wealth, and a vague plan to reach it.
Yet his bold deeds, and his discovery of the Pacific, are largely forgotten,
for he committed what in the world of power is the ultimate sin: He went

part way, leaving the door open for others to take over. A real man of
power would have had the prudence to see the dangers in the distance——
the rivals who would want to share in the conquests, the vultures that
would hover once they heard the word “gold.” Balboa should have kept
his knowledge of the Incas secret until after he had conquered Peru. Only
then would his wealth, and his head, have been secure. Once Pedrarias ar-

rived on the scene, a man of power and prudence would have schemed to
kill or imprison him, and to take over the army he had brought for the

conquest of Peru. But Balboa was locked in the moment, always reacting

emotionally, never thinking ahead.
What good is it to have the greatest dream in the world if others reap
the benefits and the glory? Never lose your head over a vague, openended drearn—plan to the end.

of European power as it then stood. The main players were England,

France, and Austria. Prussia itself was one of several states in the loosely
allied German Federation. Austria, dominant member of the Federation,
made sure that the other German states remained weak, divided and sub»
missive. Bismarck believed that Prussia was destined for something far

greater than servant boy to Austria.
This is how Bismarck played the game. His first move was to start a
war with

lowly Denmark, in order to recover the former Prussian lands of
Schleswig—Holstein, He knew that these rumblings of Prussian independence might worry France and England, so he enlisted Austria in the war,
claiming that he was recovering Schleswig-Holstein for their benefit. ln a
few months,

after the

war

was

decided, Bismarck demanded that the

newly conquered lands be made part of Prussia. The Austrians of course
were furious, but
they compromised: First they agreed to give the Prusaians Schleswig, and a year later they sold them Holstein. The world
began to see that Austria was weakening and that Prussia was on the rise.
Bismarck’s next move was his boldest: In 1866 he convinced King
William of Prussia to withdraw from the German Federation, and in doing
so to go to war with Austria itself. King William’s wife, his son the crown
prince, and the princes of the other German kingdoms vehemently opposed such a war. But Bismarck, undaunted, succeeded in forcing the conflict, and Prussia’s superior army defeated the Austrians in the brutally

to march on Vienna, tak.i.ug as much land from Austria as possible. But

Bismarck stopped them--now he presented himself as

on

the side of

peace. The result was that he was able to conclude a treaty with Austria
that granted Prussia and the other German states total autonomy. Bismarck could now position Prussia. as the dominant power in Germany and

the head of a newly formed North German Confederation.
The French and the English began to compare Bismarck to Attila the
Hun, and to fear that he had designs on all of Europe. Once he had started

path to conquest, there was no telling where he would stop. And,
indeed, three years later Bismarck provoked a war with France. First he
appeared to give his permission to France’s annexation of Belgium, then
at the last moment he changed his mind. Playing a caband-mouse game,
he infuriated the French emperor, Napoleon Ill, and stirred up his own
king against the French. To no one’s surprise, war broke out in 1870. The
newly formed German federation enthusiastically joined in the war
on France, and once again the Prussian military machine and its allies
destroyed the enemy army in a matter of months. Although Bismarck
opposed taking any French land, the generals convinced him that Alsaceon the

Lorraine would become part of the federation.
Now all of Europe feared the next move of the Prussian monster, led

by Bismarck, the “Iron Chancellor.” And in fact a year later Bismarck
founded the German

Empire, with the Prussian king as the newly

crowned emperor and Bismarck himself a prince. But then something

strange happened: Bismarck instigated no more wars. And while the other
European powers grabbed up land for colonies in other continents, he se-

verely limited Germany’s colonial acquisitions. He did not want more
land for Germany, but more security. For the rest of his life he struggled to
maintain peace in Europe and to prevent further wars. Everybody assumed he had changed, mellowing with the years. They had failed to understand: This was the final move of his original plan.
Interpretation
There is a simple reason why most men never know when to come off the

attack: They form no concrete idea of their goal. Once they achieve vic-

tory they only hunger for more. To stop-—to aim for a goal and then keep
to it——seems almost inhuman, in fact; yet nothing is more critical to the
maintenance of power. The person who goes too far in his triumphs creates a reaction that inevitably leads to a decline. The only solution is to
plan for the long run. Foresee the future with as much clarity as the gods
on Mount Olympus, who look through the clouds and see the ends of all
things.
From the beginning of his career in polifics, Bismarck had one goal:
to form an independent German state led by Prussia. He instigated the
war with Denmark not to

conquer territory but to stir up Prussian nationalism and unite the country. He incited the war with Austiia only to gain

240

LAW 29

Prussian independence. (This was why he refused to grab Austrian terri-

tory.) And he fomented the war with France to unite the German kingdoms against a common enemy, and thus to prepare for the formation of a
united Germany.
Once this was achieved, Bismarck stopped. He never let triumph go
to his head, was never tempted by the siren call of more. He held the rei.ns

tightly, and whenever the generals, or the king, or the Prussian people demanded new conquests, he held them back. Nothing would spoil the
beauty of his creation, certainly not a false euphoria that pushed those
around him to attempt to go past the end that he had so carefully planned.
Experience shows that, if anef0Teset4.9_f1“amfaT away the designs to be
undertaken, one can act with speed when the moment comes to execute them.
Cardimzf ftichelieru, 1585-1642

KEYS TO POWER

According to the cosmology of the ancient Greeks, the gods were thought
to have complete vision into the future. They saw everything to come,
right down to the intricate details. Men, on the other hand, were seen as
victims of fate, trapped in the moment and their emotions, unable to see
beyond immediate dangers. Those heroes, such as Odysseus, who were
able to look beyond the present and plan several steps ahead, seemed to
defy fate, to approximate the gods in their ability to determine the future.
The comparison is still va.1id—those among us who think further ahead
and patiently bring their plans to fruition seem to have a godlike power.
Because most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan with

this kind of foresight, the ability to ignore immediate dangers and plea-

power. It is the power of being able to overcome the
natural human tendency to react to things as they happen, and instead to
sures translates into

train oneself to step back, imagining the larger things taking shape beyond

one’s immediate vision. Most people believe that they are in fact aware of
the future, that they are planning and thinking ahead. They are usually de-

luded: What they are really doing is succumbing to their desires, to what

they want the future to be. Their plans are vague, based on their imaginations rather than their reality. They may believe they are thinking all the
way to the end, but they are really only focusing on the happy ending, and
deluding themselves by the strength of their desire.
In 415 B.C., the ancient Athenians attacked Sicily, believing their expedition would bring them riches, power, and a glorious ending to the sixteen-year Peloponnesian War. They did not consider the dangers of an
invasion so far from home; they did not foresee that the Sicilians would
light all the harder since the battles were in their own homeland, or that
all of Athens’s enemies would band together against them, or that war
would break out on several fronts, stretching their forces way too thin.
The Sicilian expedition was a complete disaster, leading to the destruction

.24!

of one of the greatest civilizations of all time. The Athenians were led into

this disaster by their hearts, not their minds. They saw only the chance of

glory, not the dangers that loomed in the distance.
Cardinal de Retz, the seventeenth-century Frenchman who prided
himself on his insights into human schemes and why they mostly fail, analyzed this phenomenon. In the course of a rebellion he spearheaded
against the French monarchy in 1651, the young king, Louis XIV, and his
court had suddenly left Paris and established themselves in a palace outside the capital. The presence of the king so close to the heart of the revolution had been a tremendous burden on the revolutionaries, and they
breathed a sigh of relief. This later proved their downfall, however, since
the court’s absence from Paris gave it much more room to maneuver.
“The most ordinary cause of people’s mistakes,” Cardinal de Retz later
wrote, “is their being too much frightened at the present danger, and not
enough so at that which is remote.”
The dangers that are remote, that loom in the distance-—if we can see

them as they take shape, how many mistakes we avoid. How many plans
would instantly abort if we realized we were avoiding a small danger
only to step into a larger one. So much of power is not what you do but
we

what you do not do——the rash and foolish actions that you refrain from before they get you into trouble. Plan in detail before you act—do not let

plans lead you into trouble. Will this have unintended consequences? Will I stir up new enemies? Will someone else take advantage of
my labors? Unhappy endings are much more common than happy
ones——do not be swayed by the happy ending in your mind.
The French elections of 1848 came down to a struggle between LouisAdolphe Thiers, the man of order, and General Louis Eugene Cavaignac,
the rabble-rouser of the right When Thiers realized he was hopelessly behind in this high—stakes race, he searched desperately for a solution. His
eye fell on Louis Bonaparte, grand-nephew of the great general Napoleon,
and a lowly deputy in the parliament. This Bonaparte seemed a bit of an
imbecile, but his name alone could get him elected in a country yearning
for a strong ruler. He would be Thiers’s puppet and eventually would be
pushed offstage. The first part of the plan worked to perfection, and
Napoleon was elected by a large margin. The problem was that Thiers
had not foreseen one simple fact: This “imbecile” was in fact a man of
enormous ambition. Three
years later he dissolved parliament, declared
himself emperor, and ruled France for another eighteen years, much to

vague

the horror of Thiers and his party.
The ending is everything. It is the end of the action that determines
who gets the glory, the money, the prize. Your conclusion must be crystal

clear, and you must keep it constantly in mind. You must also figure out
how to ward off the vultures circling overhead, trying to live off the carof your creation. And you must anticipate the many possible crises
that will tempt you to improvise. Bismarck overcame these dangers because he
planned to the end, kept on course through every crisis, and
cass

never

let others steal the glory. Once he had reached his stated goal, he

withdrew into his shell like a turtle. This kind of selfcontrol is godlike.
When you see several steps ahead, and plan your moves all the way
to the end, you will no longer be tempted by emotion or by the desire to

improvise. Your clarity will rid you of the anxiety and vagueness that are
the primary reasons why so many fail to conclude their actions success-

fully. You see the ending and you tolerate no deviation.

REVERSAL
It is a cliché among strategists that your plan must include alternatives and
have a degree of flexibility. T hat is certainly true. If you are locked into a

plan too rigidly, you will be unable to deal with sudden shifts of fortune.
Once you have examined the future possibilities and decided on your target, you must build in alternatives and be open to new routes toward your

goal.
Most people, however, lose less from overplanning and rigidity than
from vagueness and a tendency to improvise constantly in the face of Ci1‘~

origins in ancient times, but it reached its peak of refinement in the six~
teenth century under its most renowned practitioner, Sen no Rjlcyu. Al-

though not from a noble family, Rikyu rose to great power, becoming the
preferred tea master of the Emperor Hideyoshi, and an important adviser
on aesthetic and even political matters. For
Rikyu, the secret of success
consisted in appearing natural, concealing the effort behind one’s work.
One day Rikyu and his son went to an acquaintance’s house for a tea
ceremony. On the way in, the son remarked that the lovely antique—look~
ing gate at their host’s house gave it an evocatively lonely appearance. “I
don’t think so,” replied his father, “it looks as though it had been brought
from some mountain temple along way off, and as if the labor required to
import it must have cost a lot of money.” If the owner of the house had put
this much effort into one gate, it would show in his tea ceremony-—-and indeed Sen no Rikyu had to leave the ceremony early, unable to endure the
affectation and effort it inadvertently revealed.
On another evening, while having tea at a friend’s house, Rikyu saw
his host go outside, hold up a lantem in the darkness, cut a lemon off a tree,
and bring it in. This charmed Rikyu--the host needed a. relish for the dish
he was serving, and had spontaneously gone outside to get one. But when
the man offered the lemon with some Osaka rice cake, Rikyu realized that
he had planned the cutting of the lemon all along, to go with this expensive

delicacy. The gesture no longer seemed spontane0us—~it was a way for the
host to prove his cleverness. He had accidentally revealed how hard he
was
trying. Having seen enough, Rikyu politely declined the cake, excused
himself, and left.

Emperor Hideyoshi once planned to visit Rikyu for a. tea ceremony.
On the night before he was to come, snow began to fall. Thinking quickly,
Rikyu laid round cushions that fit exactly on each of the steppingvstones
that led through the garden to his house. Just before dawn, he rose, saw
that it had stopped snowing, and carefully removed the cushions. When

Hideyoshi arrived, he marveled at the simple beauty of the sight-—tl1e perfectly round stepping stones, unencumbered by snow——-and noticed how it
called no attention to the manner in which Rikyu had accomplished it, but
only to the polite gesture itself.
After Sen no Rikyu died, his ideas had a profound influence on the
practice of the tea ceremony. The Tokugawa shogun Yorinobu, son of the
great Emperor Ieyasu, was a student of Rikyu's teachings. In his garden he
had a stone lantern made by a famous master, and Lord Sakai Tadakatsu
asked if he could come by one day to see it. Yoriuobu replied that he would
be honored, and commanded his gardeners to put everything in order for
the visit. These gardeners, unfamiliar with the precepts of Cha-no~yu,
thought the stone lantern misshapen, its windows being too small for the
present taste. They had a local workman enlarge the windows. A few days
before Lord Sakai’s visit, Yorinobu toured the garden. ‘When he saw the al-

tered windows he exploded with rage, ready to impale on his sword the

night, and with the luck of a good wind they arrived just in time. To ‘[011nobu’s delight, this stone lantern was more magnificent than the first, for it

The great escape artist Harry Houdini once advertised his act as “The lm~

felt that what he did onstage contradicted commonsense ideas of human

capacity.

to watch

Houdini accept a challenge: to escape from a. pair of manacles
billed as the strongest ever invented. They contained six sets of locks and
nine tumblers in each cuff; a Birmingham maker had spent five years con-

structing them. Experts who examined them said they had never seen anything so intricate, and this intricacy was thought to make them impossible
to

escape.
The crowd watched the experts secure the manacles on Houdini’s

wrists. Then the escape artist entered a black cabinet on stage. The minutes

went by; the more time

passed, the more certain it seemed that these man»

acles would be the first to defeat him. At one point he emerged from the

cabinet, and asked that the cuffs be temporarily removed so that he could
take off his coat—it was hot inside. The challengers refused, suspecting his
request was a trick to find out how the locks worked. Undeterred, and with
out using his hands, Houdini managed to lift the coat over his shoulders,
turn it inside out, remove a penknife from his vest pocket with his teeth,
and, by moving his head, out the coat off his arms. Freed from the coat, he
stepped back into the cabinet, the audience roaring with approval at his
grace and dexterity.

Finally, having kept the audience wailing long enough, Houdini
emerged from the cabinet a second time, now with his hands free, the manacles raised high in triumph. To this day no one knows how he managed
the escape. Although he had taken close to an hour to free himself, he had
never looked concerned, had shown no
sign of doubt. Indeed it seemed by
the end that he had drawn out the escape as a way to heighten the drama,
to make the audience worry-—-for there was no other sign that the perfon
mance had been anything but easy. The complaint about the heat was
equally part of the act. The spectators of this and other Houdini perfon
mances must have felt he was

toying with them: These manacles are noth~

ing, he seemed to say, I could have freed myself a lot sooner, and from a
lot worse.
Over the years, Houdini escaped from the chained carcass of an em
balmed “sea monster” (3. half octopus, half whalelike beast that had
beached near Boston); he had himself sealed inside an enormous envelope
from which he emerged without breaking the paper; he passed through
brick walls; he wriggled free from straitjackets while dangling high in the

air; he leaped from bridges into icy waters, his hands manacled and his legs
in chains; he had himself submerged in glass cases full of water, hands padlocked, while the audience watched in amazement as he worked himself

free, struggling for close to an hour apparently without breathing. Each
time he seemed to court certain death yet survived with superhuman
aplomb. Meanwhile, he said nothing about his methods, gave no clues as

accomplished any of his tricks——~he left his audiences and critics
speculating, his power and reputation enhanced by their struggles with the
inexplicable. Perhaps the most baffling trick of all was making a ten—thousa.ud—pound elephant disappear before an audience’s eyes, a feat he re
peated on stage for over nineteen weeks. No one has ever really explained
how he did this, for in the auditorium where he performed the trick, there
was
simply nowhere for an elephant to hide.

The effortlessness of Houdin1"s escapes led some to think he used occult forces, his superior psychic abilities giving him special control over his

body. But a German escape artist named Kleppini claimed to know Hon»

On the night of the challenge, just as Kleppini had planned, Houdini

rounded to the bottom,

quick test, and reemerged seconds later, confident of victory.
Acting as if he sensed fraud, Houdini refused to lock Kleppini in the
cuffs. The two men argued and began to fight, even wrestling with each
other onstage. After a few minutes of this, an apparently angry, frustrated

Houdini gave up and locked Kleppini in the cuffs. For the next few minutes

Kleppini strained to get free. Something was wrong——minutes earlier he
had opened the cuffs behind the screen; now the same code no longer
worked. He sweated, racking his brains. Hours went by, the audience left,
and finally an exhausted and humiliated Kleppini gave up and asked to be

Although we do not know for certain how Houdini accomplished many of

ics, whatever he could use. Every moment not spent researching he spent

working his body, keeping himself exceptionally limher, and learning how
to control his muscles and his breathing.
Early on in Houdini’s career, an old Japanese performer whom he
toured with taught him an ancient trick: how to swallow an ivory ball, then
bring it back up. He practiced this endlessly with a small peeled potato tied
to a string—up and down he would manipulate the potato with his throat
muscles, until they were strong enough to move it without the string. The
organizers of the London handcuff challenge had searched Houdini’s body
thoroughly beforehand, but no one could check the inside of his throat,
where he could have concealed small tools to help him escape. Even so,
Kleppini was fundamentally wrong: It was not Houdini’s tools but his practice, work, and research that made his escapes possible.
Kleppini, in fact, was completely outwitted by Houdini, who set the
whole thing up. He let his opponent learn the code to the French cuffs,
LAW 30

249

then baited him into choosing those cuffs onstage. Then, during the two
men’s tussle, the dexterous Houdini was able to change the code to “ERAvU-D.” He had spent weeks practicing this trick, but the audience saw
none

of the sweat and toil behind the scenes. Nor was Houdini ever ner-

vous; he induced nervousness in others.

(He deliberately dragged out the

time it would take to escape, as a way of heightening the drama, and mak-

ing the audience squirm.) His escapes from death, always graceful and
easy, made him look like a superman.
As a person of power, you must research and practice endlessly before

appearing in public, onstage or anywhere else. Never expose the sweat and
labor behind your poise. Some think such exposure will demonstrate their
diligence and honesty, but it actually just makes them look weaker-—as if
anyone who practiced and worked at it could do what they had done, or as
if they weren’t really up to the job. Keep your effort and your tricks to
yourself and you seem to have the grace and ease of a. god. One never sees
the source of a god’s power revealed; one only sees its effects.

KEYS TO POWER

Humanity‘s first notions of power came from primitive encounters with nature-—the flash of lightning in the sky, a sudden flood, the speed and feroc
ity of a wild animal. These forces required no thinking, no planning—they
awed us by their sudden appearance, their gracefulness, and their power
over life and death. And this remains the kind of
power we have always
wanted to imitate. Through science and technology we have recreated the
speed and sublime power of nature, but something is missing: Our ma~
chines are noisy and jerky, they reveal their effort. Even the very best creations of technology cannot root out our admiration for things that move
easily and effortlessly. The power of children to bend us to their will comes
from a kind of seductive charm that we feel in the presence‘ of a creature
less reflective and more graceful than we are. We cannot retum to such a

state, but if we can create the appearance of this kind of ease, we elicit in
others the kind of primitive awe that nature has always evoked in humankind.
One of the first European writers to expound on this principle came
from that most unnatural of environments, the Renaissance court. In 771:

Book of the Courtier, published in 1528, Baldassare Castiglione describes the

highly elaborate and codified manners of the perfect court citizen. And yet,
Castiglione explains, the courtier must execute these gestures with what he
calls .r[mzz,zatu1a, the capacity to make the difficult seem easy. He urges the
courtier to “practice in all things a certain nonchalance which conceals all

250

artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effortless.” We all admire the achievement of some unusual feat, but if it is ac-

complished naturally and gracefully, our admiration increases tenfold-—
“whereas

.

.

to labor at what one is doing and

.

.

.

to make bones over it,

shows an extreme lack of grace and causes everything, whatever its worth,
to be discounted.”

Much of the idea of sprezzalura came from the world of art. All the

great Renaissance artists carefully kept their works under wraps. Only the
finished masterpiece could be shown to the public. Michelangelo forbade
popes to view his work in process. A Renaissance artist was always
careful to keep his studios shut to patrons and public alike, not out of fear
even

of imitation, but because to see the making of the works would mar the
magic of their effect, and their studied atmosphere of ease and natural
beauty.
The Renaissance painter Vasari, also the first great art critic, ridiculed
the work of Paolo Uccello, who was obsessed with the laws of perspective.
The elfort Uccello spent on improving the appearance of perspective was
too obvious in his work——it made his paintings ugly and labored, overwhelmed by the elicit of their effects. We have the same response when we
watch performers who put too much effort into their act: Seeing them trying so hard breaks the illusion. It also makes us uncomfortable. Calm,
graceful performers, on the other hand, set us at ease, creating the illusion
that they are not acting but being natural and themselves, even when
everything they are doing involves labor and practice.
The idea of sprewztum is relevant to all forms of power, for power

depends vitally on appearances and the illusions you create. Your public
actions are like artworks: They must have visual appeal, must create antici»
pation, even entertain. When you reveal the inner workings of your cre—
ation, you become just one more mortal among others. What is
understandable is not awe-inspiring-—we tell ourselves we could do as well
if we had the money and time. Avoid the

temptation of showing how

clever you are-—it is far more clever to conceal the mechanisms of your
cleverness.

Talleyrand’s application of this concept to his daily life greatly en»
hanced the aura of power that surrounded him. He never liked to work too
hard, so he made others do the work for hirn—-the spying, the research, the
detailed analyses. With all this labor at his disposal, he himself never
seemed to strain. VVhen his spies revealed that a certain event was about to
take place, he would talk in social conversation as if he sensed its imminence.

The result was that people thought he was clairvoyant. His short

government, including Napoleon himself, Talleyrand gave the impression
of immense power—an effect entirely dependent on the apparent ease
with which he accomplished his feats.
There is another reason for concealing your shortcuts and tricks:

LAW 30

251

When you let this information out, you give people ideas they can use

against you. You lose the advantages of keeping silent. We tend to want the
world to know what we have done--we want our vanity gratified by hay»
ing our hard work and cleverness applauded, and we may even want sym—
pathy for the hours it has taken to reach our point of artistry. Learn to
control this propensity to blab, for its effect is often the opposite of what
you expected. Remember: The more mystery surrounds your actions, the
more awesome
your power seems, You appear to be the only one who can
do what you do--and the appearance of having an exclusive

is im-

mensely powerful. Finally, because you achieve your accomplishments
with grace and ease, people believe that you could always do more if you

tried harder. This elicits not only admiration but a touch of fear. Your powers are

untapped-——no one can fathom their limits.

Image: The Racehorse. From up close we would see the
strain, the effort to control the horse, the labored, painful
breathing. But from the distance where we sit and watch, it
is all gracefulness, flying through the air. Keep others at a
distance and they will only see the ease with which you move.

Authority: For whatever action [nonchalance] accompanies, no
matter how trivial it is, it not only reveals the skill of the person
doing it but also very often causes it to be considered far greater
than it really is. This is because it makes the onlookers believe that
a man who
performs well with so much faxsility must possess even
skill
than he does. (Baldassare Castiglione, 14784529)

REVE RSAL
The secrecy with which you surround your azztions must seem lighthearted
in spirit. A zeal to conceal your work creates an unpleasant, almost paranoiar: impression: you are taking the game too seriously. Houdini was care»

ful to make the concealment of his tricks seem a game, all part of the show.
Never show your work until it is finished, but if you put too much effort
into keeping it under wraps you will be like the painter Pontormo, who

spent the last years of his life hiding his frescoes from the public eye and

only succeeded in driving himself mad. Always keep your sense of humor
about yourself.
There are also times when revealing the inner workings of your pm
jects can prove worthwhile. It all depends on your andience’s taste, and on
252

the times in which you operate. P. T. Barnum recognized that his public
wanted to feel involved in his shows, and that understanding his tricks de-

lighted them, partly, perhaps, because implicitly debunking people who
kept their sources of power hidden from the masses appealed to Ametica’s
democratic spirit. The public also appreciated the showman’s humor and
honesty. Barnum took this to the extreme of publicizing his own humbug—
gery in his popular autobiogzaphy, written when his career was at its
height.
As long as the partial disclosure of tricks and techniques is carefully
planned, rather than the result of an uncontrollable need to blab, it is the
ultimate in cleverness. It gives the audience the illusion of being superior
and involved, even while much of what you do remains concealed from
them.

certain anarchy, or his accession to absolute power. To back up his move,

he made it clear that he preferred to abdicate: “Call my bluffi” he said,
“and watch what happens.” No one called his bluff. By withdrawing for just

Withdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the op»

you offer them a “choice”: I stay away and you suffer the consequences, or
I retum under circumstances that I dictate. In this method of controlling

people’s options, they choose the option that gives you power because the
alternative is just too unpleasant. You force their hand, but indirectly: They
seem to have a choice. Whenever people feel they have a choice, they walk

OBSELRVANCE OF THE LAW II
As a seventeenth-century French courtesan, Ninon de Lenclos found that

her life had certain pleasures. Her lovers came from royalty and aristocracy, and they paid her well, entertained her with their wit and intellect,
satisfied her rather demanding sensual needs, and treated her almost as an

equal. Such a life was infinitely preferable to marriage. In 1643, however,
Ninon’s mother died suddenly, leaving her, at the age of twenty-three, to
tally alone in the world-«no family, no dowry, nothing to fallback upon. A
kind of panic overtook her and she entered a convent, tuming her back on

her illustrious lovers. A year later she left the convent and moved to Lyons.

Those who did not want to be what Ninon called a payeur could join

the large and growing group of men she called her martyrs--men who vis—
ited her apartment principally for her friendship, her biting wit, her luteplaying, and the company of the most vibrant minds of the period,
including Moliere, La Rochefoucauld, and Saint~Evremond. The martyrs,
too, however, entertained a possibility: She would regularly select from
them a fiwori, a man who would become her lover without having to pay,
and to whom she would abandon herself completely for as long as she so
desired-—«a week, a few months, rarely longer. A payeur could not become a

scandalized the queen mother and her court. Much to their horror, however, it did not discourage her male suitors—indeed it only increased their
numbers and intensified their desire, It became an honor to be a payeur,

helping Ninon to maintain her lifestyle and her glittering salon, accompanying her sometimes to the theater, and sleeping with her when she chose.
Even more distinguished were the martyrs, enjoying her company without
paying for it and maintaining the hope, however remote, of some day becoming her fizvorz‘. That possibility spurred on many a young nobleman, as
word spread that none among the courtesans could surpass Ninon in the
art of love. And so the married and the single, the old and the young, en-

tered her web and chose one of the two options presented to them, both of
which amply satisfied her.

Interpretation
The life of the courtesan entailed the possibility of a power that was denied
a married woman, but it also had obvious

perils. The man who paid for the

courtesaxfs services in essence owned her, determining when he could pos-

when, later on, he would abandon her. As she grew older, her
options narrowed, as fewer men chose her. To avoid a life of poverty she

then, she faced a most difficult fate.
Ninon de Lenclos had a horror of any kind of dependence. She early
on tasted a kind of

equality with her lovers, and she would not settle into a

system that left her such distasteful options. Strangely enough, the system
she devised in its place seemed to satisfy her suitors as much as it did her.

The payeur: may have had to pay, but the fact that Ninon would only sleep
with them when she wanted to gave them a thrill unavailable with every

other courtesan: She was yielding out of her own desire. The martyrs’
avoidance of the taint of having to pay gave them a sense of superiority; as
members of Ninon’s fraternity of admirers, they also might some day expe
rience the ultimate pleasure of being her favari.

Finally, Ninon did not

force her suitors into either category. They could “choose” which side they

prefer:-ed—a freedom flint left them a vestige of masculine pride.
Such is the power of giving people a choice, or rather the illusion of
one, for they are playing with cards you have dealt them. Where the alternatives set up by Ivan the Terrible involved a certain risk—-one option
would have led to his losing his power——Ninon created a. situation in which
every option redounded to her favor. From the payeurs she received the
money she needed to run her salon. And from the martyrs she gained the

ultimate in power: She could surround herself with a. bevy of admirers, a
harem from which to choose her lovers.

KEYS TO POWER

Words like “freedom,” “options,” and “choice” evoke a power of possibility
far beyond the reality of the benefits they entail. When examined closely,
the choices we have——in the marketplace, in elections, in our jobs»-tend to

have noticeable limitations: They are often a matter of a choice simply between A and B, with the rest of the
as

alphabet out of the picture. Yet as long

the faintest mirage of choice flickers on, we rarely focus on the missing

options. We “choose” to believe that the game is fair, and that we have our
freedom. We prefer not to think too much about the depth of our liberty to
choose.
This unwillingness to probe the smallness of our choices stems from
the fact that too much freedom creates a kind of amdety. The phrase “un-

limited options” sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited options would
actually paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose. Our limited range of
choices comforts us.
258

LAW 31

This supplies the clever and cunning with enormous opportunities for
deception. For people who are choosing between alternatives find it hard

Setting up a narrow range of
powerful imposition your
choices, then, should always be a part of your deceptions. There is a say-

ing: If you can get the bird to walk into the cage on its own, it will sing that
much more prettily.

The following are among the most common forms of “controlling the

options”:
Color the Choices. This was a favored technique of Henry Kissinger. As
President Richard Nixon’s secretary of state, Kissinger considered himself
better informed than his boss, and believed that in most situations he could

make the best decision on his own. But if he tried to determine policy, he
would offend or perhaps enrage a notoriously insecure man. So Kissinger

would propose three or four choices of action for each situation, and would

present them in such a way that the one he preferred always seemed the
best solution compared to the others. Time afler time, Nixon fell for the

bait, never suspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed him.
This is an excellent device to use on the insecure master.
Force the Resistor. One of the main problems faced by Dr. Milton H. Er-

ickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the relapse. His pa»
tients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their apparent susceptibility
to the

therapy masked a deep resistance: They would soon relapse into old

habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming to see him. To avoid this, Ericlo
son began ordering some patients to have a relapse, to make themselves feel
as bad as when
they first came in—-——to go back to square one. Faced with
this option, the patients would usually “choose” to avoid the relapse-

which, of course, was what Erickson really wanted.
This is a good technique to use on children and other willful people
who enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push them to

“choose” what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite.
Alter the Playing Field. In the 1860s,john D. Rockefeller set out to cre-

monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil companies they
would figure out what he was doing and fight back. Instead, he began secretly buying up the railway companies that transported the oil. When he
then attempted to take over a particular company, and met with resistance,
he reminded them of their dependence on the rails. Refusing them shipping, or simply raising their fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller a.l~
tered the playing field so that the only options the small oil producers had

Shrinking Options. The latemineteenth-century art dealer Am-

The

broise Vollard perfected this technique.
Customers would come to Volla.rd’s shop to see some Cézannes. He
would show three paintings, neglect to mention a price, and pretend to

doze off. The visitors would have to leave without deciding. They would

usually come back the next day to see the paintings again, but this time
Vollard would pull out less interesting works, pretending he thought they
were

the same ones. The baffled customers would look at the new offer-

ings, leave to think them over, and return yet again. Once again the same

thing would happen: Vollard would show paintings of lesser quality still. Finally the buyers would realize they had better grab what he was showing
them, because tomorrow they would have to settle for something worse,
perhaps at even higher prices.
A variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the buyer
hesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent negotiating ploy to
use on the
chronically indecisive, who will fall for the idea that they are geta better deal
ting
today than if they wait till tomorrow.
The Weak Man on the Precipice. The weak are the easiest to maneuver

by controlling their options. Cardinal do Retz, the great seventeenth~century provocateur, served as an unofficial assistant to the Duke of Orléans,
who was notoriously indecisive. It was a constant struggle to convince the
duke to take action»-—-he would hem and haw, weigh the options, and wait

till the last moment, giving everyone around him an ulcer. But Retz discov~
ered a way to handle him: He would describe all sorts of dangers, exaggep

ating them as much as possible, until the duke saw a yawning abyss in
every direction except one: the one Retz was pushing him to take.
This tactic is similar to “Color the Choices,” but with the weak you
have to be more aggressive. Work on their emotions—use fear and terror

propel them into action. Tn: reason and they will always find a way to
procrastinate.

to

Brothers in Crime. This is a classic convartist technique: You attract your
victims to some criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood and guilt between you. They participate in your deception, commit a crime (or think

they do-—-see the story of Sam Geezil in Law 3), and are easily manipulated. Serge Stavisky, the great French con artist of the 1920s, so entangled
the government in his scams and swindles that the state did not dare to

prosecute him, and “chose” to leave him alone. It is often wise to implicate
in your deceptions the very person who can do you the most harm if you

fail. Their involvement can be subtle—-even a hint of their involvement
will narrow their options and buy their silence.
The Horns of a Dilemma. This idea was demonstrated by General
William Sherma.n’s infamous march through Georgia during the American
Civil War. Although the Confederates knew what direction Sherman was

2&0

LAW’ 31

heading in, they never knew if he would attack from the left or the right, for
he divided his army into two wings--and if the rebels retreated from one
wing they found themselves facing the other. This is a classic trial lawyer’s
technique: The lawyer leads the witnesses to decide between two possible
explanations of an event, both of which poke a hole in their story. They
have to answer the lawyer’s questions, but whatever they say they hurt
themselves. The key to this move is to strike quickly: Deny the victim the
time to think of an escape. As they wriggle between the horns of the
dilemma, they dig their own grave.
Understand: In your struggles with your rivals, it will often be necessary
for you to hurt them. And if you are clearly the agent of their punishment,

expect a counterat1ack——expect revenge. If, however, they seem to themselaes to be the agents of their own misfortune, they will submit quietly.
When Ivan left Moscow for his rural village, the citizens asking him to re-

agreed to his demand for absolute power. Over the years to come,
resented
him less for the terror he unleashed on the country, because,
they
turn

alter all, they had granted him his power themselves. This is why it is al
ways good to allow your victims their choice of poison, and to cloak your
involvement in providing it to them as far as possible.

REVERSAI.

Controlling the options has one main purpose: to disguise yourself as the
agent of power and punishment. The tactic works best, then, for those
whose power is fragile, and who cannot operate too openly without incur-

ring suspicion, resentment, and anger. Even as a general rule, however, it is
rarely wise to be seen as exerting power directly and forcefully, no matter
how secure or strong you are. It is usually more elegant and more effective
to give

people the illusion of choice.

On the other hand, by limiting other people’s options you sometimes
limit your own. There are situations in which it is to your advantage to
allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you watch them operate,
you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather information, and plan
your deceptions. The nineteenth~century banker James Rothschild liked
this method: He felt that if he tried to control his opponents’ movements,

he lost the chance to observe their strategy and plan a more effective
course.

The more freedom he allowed them in the short term, the more

forcefully he could act against them in the long run.

LAW 32

The cityvstate of Venice was prosperous for so long that its citizens felt their
small republic had destiny on its side. In the Middle Ages and High Re

naissance, its virtual monopoly on trade to the east made it the wealthiest

city in Europe. Under a beneficent republican government, Venelians en-

joyed liberties that few other Italians had ever known. Yet in the sixteenth
century their fortunes suddenly changed, The opening of the New World
transferred power to the Atlantic side of Europewto the Spanish and Fortuguese, and later the Dutch and English. Venice could not compete eco
nomically and its empire gradually dwindled. The final blow was the
devastating loss of a prized Mediterranean possession, the island of
Cyprus, captured from Venice by the Turks in 1570.
Now noble families went broke in Venice, and banks began to fold. A
kind of gloom and depression settled over the citizens. They had known a
glittering past~—-had either lived through it or heard stories about it from
their elders. The closeness of the glory years was humiliating. The Vene—
clans half believed that the goddess Fortune was only playing a joke on
them, and that the old days would soon return. For the time being, though,
what could they do?
In 1589 rumors began to swirl around Venice of the a.m‘val not far
away of a mysterious man called “ll Bragadino," a master of alchemy, a
man who had won incredible wealth through his
ability, it was said, to multhe
use of a secret substance. The rumor
spread quickly
tiply gold through
because a few years earlier, a Venetian nobleman passing through Poland
had heard a learned man prophesy that Venice would recover her past
glory and power if she could find a man who understood the alchemic art
of manufacturing gold. And so, as word reached Venice of the gold this
Bragadino possessed——he clinked gold coins continuously in his hands,
and golden objects filled his palace-some began to dream: Through him,
their city would prosper again.
Members of Venice’s most important noble families accordingly went

together to Brescia, where Bragadino lived. They toured his palace and
watched in awe as he demonstrated his gold-making abilities, taking a
pinch of seemingly worthless minerals and transforming it into several
ounces of gold dust. The Venetian senate prepared to debate the idea of ex
tending an ofllcial invitation to Bragadino to stay in Venice at the city’s expense, when word suddenly reached them that they were competing with
the Duke of Mantua for his services. They heard of a magnificent party in
Bragadinds palace for the duke, featuring garments with golden buttons,
gold watches, gold plates, and on and on. Worried they might lose Bragaclino (0 Martina, the senate voted almost unanimously to invite him to
Venice, promising him the mountain of money he would need to continue

living in his luxurious style-~but only if he came right away.
Late that year the mysterious Bragaclino arrived in Venice. With his
piercing dark eyes under thick brows, and the two enormous black mastiffs
that accompanied him everywhere, he was forbidding and impressive. He
took up residence in a sumptuous palace on the island of the Giudecca,

with the republic funding his banquets, his expensive clothes, and all his

other whims. A kind of alchemy fever spread through Venice. On street
corners, hawkers would sell

coal, distilling apparatus, bellows, how—to

books on the subject. Everyone began to practice alchemyw-everyone ex—

cept Bragadino.
The alchemist seemed to be in no hurry to begin manufacturing the

gold that would save Venice from ruin. Strangely enough this only increased his popularity and following; people thronged from all over Europe, even Asia, to meet this remarkable man. Months went by, with gifts
pouring in to Bragadino from all sides. Still he gave no sign of the miracle
that the Venetians confidently expected him to produce. Eventually the citizens began to grow impatient, wondering if he would wait forever. At first
the senators warned them not to hurry him-—-he was a capricious devil,
who needed to be cajoled. Finally, though, the nobility began to wonder
too, and the senate came under pressure to show a return on the city’s ba.l~
looning investment.
Bragadino had only scorn for the doubters, but he responded to them.
He had, he said, already deposited in the city’s mint the mysterious substance with which he
multiplied gold. He could use this substance up all at
and
double
the gold, but the more slowly the process took
once,
produce
the
more it would
place,
yield. If left alone for seven years, sealed in a cas
the
substance
would
ket,
multiply the gold in the mint thirty times over.
Most of the senators agreed to wait to reap the gold mine Bragadino
promised. Others, however, were angry: seven more years of this man living royally at the public trough! And many of the common citizens of
Venice echoed these sentiments. Finally the alchemist‘s enemies demanded
he produce a proof of his skills: a substantial amount of gold, and soon.
Lofty, apparently devoted to his art, Bragadino responded that Venice,
in its impatience, had betrayed him, and would therefore lose his services.
He left town, going first to nearby Padua, then, in 1590, to Munich, at the
invitation of the Duke of Bavaria, who, like the entire city of Venice, had
known great wealth but had fallen into bankruptcy through his own profligacy, and hoped to regain his fortune through the famous alchemist’s services. And so Bragadino resumed the comfortable arrangement he had
known in Venice, and the same pattern repeated itself.
Interpretation
The young Cypriot Mamugna had lived in Venice for several years before

reincamating himself as the alchemist Bragadino. He saw how gloom had
settled on the city, how everyone was hoping for a redemption from some
indefinite source. While other charlatans mastered everyday cons based on
sleight of hand, Mamugna mastered human nature. With Venice as his target from the start, he traveled abroad, made some money through his
alchemy scams, and then returned to Italy, setting up shop in Brescia.
There he created a reputation that he knew would spread to Venice. From
a distance, in fact, his aura of
power would be all the more impressive.

reputation was established, and dukes and senators were fighting over him,
did he resort to the trifling necessity of a demonstration. By then, however,

people were easy to deceive: They wanted to believe. The Venetian senators who watched him multiply gold wanted to believe so badly that they
failed to notice the glass pipe up his sleeve, from which he slipped gold
dust into his pinches of minerals. Brilliant and capricious, he was the al
chemist of their fantasies—-and once he had created an aura like this, no
one noticed his

simple deceptions.

Such is the power of the fantasies that take root in us, especially in
times of scarcity and decline.

People rarely believe that their problems

arise from their own misdeeds and stupidity. Someone or something out

there is to blame—-the other, the world, the gods—and so salvation comes
from the outside as well. Had Bragadino arrived in Venice armed with a
detailed analysis of the reasons behind the city’s economic decline, and of
the hardcnosed steps that it could take to turn things around, he would

have been scorned. The reality was too ugly and the solution too painful-—
mostly the kind of hard work that the citizens‘ ancestors had mustered to
create an empire. Fantasy, on the other hand——in this case the romance of

alchemy--was easy to understand and infinitely more palatable.
To gain power, you must be a source of pleasure for those around
you--and pleasure comes from playing to people’s fantasies. Never

KEYS TO POWER

Fantasy can never operate alone. It requires the backdrop of the huxndrum
and the mundane. It is the oppressiveness of reality that allows fantasy to
take root and bloom. In sixteenth-century Venice, the reality was one of de
clirre and loss of prestige. The corresponding fantasy described a sudden
recovery of past glories through the miracle of alchemy. While the reality
only got worse, the Venetians inhabited a happy dream world in which
their city restored its fabulous wealth and power overnight, turning dust
into gold.

The person who can spin a fantasy out of an oppressive reality has access to untold

266

LAW 32

power. As you search for the fantasy that will take hold of the

keep your eye on the banal truths that weigh heavily on us
all. Never be distracted by peop1e’s glamorous portraits of themselves and

masses, then,

their lives; search and dig for what really imprisons them. Once you find

that, you have the magical key that will put great power in your hands.

Although times and people change, let us examine a few of the oppres~
sive realities that endure, and the opportunities for power they provide:

The Reality:

Change isslow and gradual. It requires ham’ work, a bit ofluck, a fair
rel
of —sacrg'fice, and a lot pfpatience.
The Fantasy: A sudden tmmfarmation will bring a total change in aneivfiirtunes,

amount

bypassing work, luck, self-sacrifice, and time in one fantastic make.
This is of course the fantasy par excellence of the charlatans who
prowl among us to this day, and was the key to B1'agadin0’s success.
Promise a great and total change-—~from poor to rich, sickness to health,
misery to ecstasy—and you will have followers.
How did the great sixteenth-century German quack Leonhard
Thumeisser become the court physician for the Elector of Brandenburg
without ever studying medicine? Instead of offering amputations, leeches,
and foul~tasting purgatives (the medicaments of the time), Thurneisser ofv
fared sweevtasting elixirs and promised instant recovery. Fashionable
courtiers especially wanted his solution of “drinkable gold,” which cost a
fortune. If some inexplicable illness assailed you, Thur-neisser would consult a horoscope and prescribe a talisman. Who could resist such a
fantasy-—-health and well-being without sacrifice and pain!
The Reality: The social realm has lzard~set codes and boundaries. We understand

time limits and know that we have to move within the same familiar circles, ziay in
and ritzy out.

ofadventure.
In the early 1700s, all London was abuzz with talk of a mysterious
stranger, a young man named George Psalmanazar. He had arrived from

what was to most Englishmen a fantastical land: the island of Formosa

(now Taiwan),

off the

coast

of China.

Oxford

University engaged

Psalmauazar to teach the island’s language; a few years later he translated
the Bible into Formosan, then wrote a bool<—ar: immediate bestseller--on
Formosa’s history and geography. English royalty wined and dined the
young man, and everywhere he went he entertained his hosts with wondrous stories of his homeland, and its bizarre customs.

After Psalmanazar died, however, his will revealed that he was in fact

merely a Frenchman with a rich imagination. Everything he had said about
Formosa——-its alphabet, its language, its literature, its entire culture-—he had
invented. He had built on the English puhlic’s ignorance of the place to
concoct an

elaborate story that fulfilled their desire for the exotic and

LAW 32

‘.767

strange. British cultu.re’s rigid control of people’s dangerous dreams gave
I

him the perfect opportunity to exploit their fantasy.
The fantasy of the exotic, of course, can also skirt the sexual. It must
not come too close, though, for tl1e physical hinders the power of fantasy; it
can

be seen, grasped, and then tired of-—the fate of most courtesans. The

bodily charms of the mistress only whet the master’s appetite for more and
different pleasures, a new beauty to adore. To bring power, fantasy must re»
main to some degree unrealized, literally unreal. The dancer Mata Hari,
for instance, who rose to public prominence in Paris before World War I,
had quite ordinary looks. Her power came from the fantasy she created of
being strange ‘and exotic, unknowable and indecipherable. The taboo she
worked with was less sex itself than the breaking of social codes.
Another form of the fantasy of the exotic is simply the hope for relief
from boredom. Con artists love to play on the oppressiveness of the working world, its lack of adventure. Their cons might involve, say, the recovery of lost Spanish treasure, with the possible participation of an alluring
Mexican sefiorita. and a connection to the president of a South American
country—a.nything oficering release from the humdrum.
The Reality:

Society is fragmented and full ofconflict.

The Fantasy: People can come together in a mystical union ofsouls.
In the 19205 the con man Oscar Hartzell made a quick fortune out of
the agevold Sir Francis Drake swindle—basically promising any sucker who

happened to be surnamed “Drake” a substantial share of the long-lost
“Drake treasure,” to which Hartzell had access. Thousands across the Midwest fell for the scam, which Hartzell

cleverly turned into a crusade against
the government and everyone else who was trying to keep the Drake for»

of the oppressed Drakes, with emotional rallies and meetings. Promise such
a union and
you can gain much power, but it is a dangerous power that can
easily turn against you. This is a fantasy for demagogues to play on.
The Reality: Death. The dead cannot be brought back, tlzepart cannot be changed.

The Fantasy.‘ A sudden reversal aftlzis intolerable fact.
This con has many variations, but requires great skill and subtlety.
The beauty and importance of the art of Vermeer have long been rec

ognized, but his paintings are small in number, and are extremely rare. In
the 1930s, though, Vermeers began to appear on the art market. Experts
were called on to
verify them, and pronounced them real. Possession of
these new Vermeers would crown a collector’s career. It was like the resurrection of Lazarus: In a strange way, Vermeer had been brought back to

life. The past had been changed.

Only later did it come out that the new Vermeers were the work of a
middle-aged Dutch forget named Han van Meegeren. And he had chosen
268

LAW 32

Vermeer for his scam because he understood fantasy: The paintings would
seem real

precisely because the public, and the experts as well, so desper-

ately wanted to believe they were.
Remember: The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure and

promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering, xhen,
should be ungraspable. Never let it become oppressively familiar; it is the
mirage in the distance, withdrawing as the sucker approaches. Never be
(no direct in describing the fantasywkeep it vague. As a forget of fantasies,
let your victim come close enough to see and be tempted, but keep him far
away enough that he stays dreaming and desiring.

269

REVERSAL
If there is power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses, there is also

danger, Fantasy usually contains an element of play-the public half realizes it is being duped, but it keeps the dream alive anyway, relishing the en»
tertainment and the temporary diversion from the everyday that you are

providing. So keep it 1ight~—never come too close to the place where you
are
actually expected to produce results. That place may prove extremely
hazardous.

After

Bragadino established himself in Munich, he found that the

sober-minded Bavarians had far less faith in alchemy than the temperamental Venelians. Only the duke really believed in it, for he needed it des—

perately to rescue him from the hopeless mess he was in. As Bragadino
played his familiar waiting game, accepting gifts and expecting patience,
the public grew angry. Money was being spent and was yielding no results.
In 1592 the Bavarians demanded justice, and eventually Bragadino found
himself swinging from the gallows. As before, he had promised and had
not delivered, but this time he had misjudged the forbearance of his hosts,
and his inability to fulfill their fantasy proved fatal.
One last thing: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy is al»
ways fantastical. It certainly contrasts with reality, but reality itself is some
times so theatrical and stylized that fantasy becomes a desire for simple
things. The image Abraham Lincoln created of himself, for example, as a
homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the common man’s
president.
P. T. Barnum created a successful act with Tom Thumb, a dwarf who

dressed up as famous leaders of the past, such as Napoleon, and iam-

pooned them wickedly. The show delighted everyone, right up to Queen
Victoria, by appealing to the fantasy of the time: Enough of the vain-

glorious rulers of history, the common man knows best Tom Thumb reversed the familiar pattern of fantasy in which the strange and unknown
becomes the ideal. But the act still obeyed the Law, for underlying it
was the
fantasy that the simple man is without problems, and is happier
than the powerful and the rich.
Both Lincoln and Tom Thumb played the commoner but carefully
maintained their distance. Should you play with such a fantasy, you too
must carefully cultivate distance and not allow your “common” persona to
become too familiar or it will not project as fantasy.

If you suspect that someone has a. particular soft spot, probe for it indi»

Pay Attention to Gestures and Unconscious Signals. As Sigmund
Freud remarked, “No mortal can keep at secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.” This is a
critical concept in the search for a person’s weakness-—it is revealed by
seemingly unimportant gestures and passing words.
The key is not only what you look for but where and how you look.
Everyday conversaiion supplies the richest mine of weaknesses, so train
yourself to listen. Start by always seeming interested——~the appearance of a
sympathetic ear will spur anyone to talk. A clever trick, often used by the
nineteenth-century French statesman Talleyrand, is to appear to open up to
the other person, to share a secret with them. It can be completely made
up, or it can be real but of no great importance to you——-the important
thing is that it should seem to come from the heart. This will usually elicit at
response that is not only as frank as yours but more genuine»-a response

Find the Helpless Child. Most weaknesses begin in childhood, before
the self builds up compensatory defenses. Perhaps the child was pampered

indulged in a particular area, or perhaps a certain emotional need went
unfulfilled; as he or she grows older, the indulgence or the deficiency may
be buried but never disappears. Knowing about a childhood need gives
you a powerful key to a person’s weakness.
or

One sign of this weakness is that when you touch on it the person will
often act like a child. Be on the lookout, then, for any behavior that should

have been outgrown. If your victims or rivals went without something im-

portant, such as parental support, when they were children, supply it, or its
facsimile. If they reveal a secret taste, a hidden indulgence, indulge it. In either case they will be unable to resist you.

Louis, as the regent ruling France until her son reached his majority. Every-

expected Richelieu to say the usual kind words to the young king. In
stead, however, he looked directly at and only at the queen mofher. indeed
his speech ended in long and fulsome praise of her, praise so glowing that it
actually offended some in the Church. But the smile on the queen’s face as
she lapped up Richelielfs compliments was unforgettable.
A year later the queen mother appointed Richelieu secretary of state
for foreign affairs, an incredible coup for the young bishop. He had now
entered the inner circle of power, and he studied the workings of the court
as if it were the machinery of a watch. An Italian, Concino Concini, was
one

the queen mother’s favorite, or rather her lover, a role that made him per-

haps the most powerful man in France. Concini was vain and foppish, and
Richelieu played him perfectly—-attending to him as if he were the king.
Within months Richelieu had become one of Concim"s favorites. But
something happened in 1617 that turned everything upside down: the
young king, who up until then had shown every sign of being an idiot, had
Concini murdered and his most important associates imprisoned. In so

doing Louis took command of the country with one blow, sweeping the
queen mother aside.
Had Richelieu played it wrong? He had been close to both Concini

and Marie de Médicis whose advisers and ministers were now all out of

favor, some even arrested. The queen mother herself was shut up in the
Louvre, a virtual prisoner. Richelieu wasted no time. If everyone was deserfing Marie de Médicis, he would stand by her. He knew Louis could not
get rid of her, for the king was still very young, and had in any case always
been inordinately attached to her. As Man'e’s only remaining powerful

mother grew still more dependent on him, and in 1622 she repaid him for
his loyalty: Through the intercession of her allies in Rome, Richelieu was

elevated to the powerful rank of cardinal.

By 1623 King Louis was in trouble. He had no one he could trust to
advise him, and although he was now a young man instead of a boy, he re
mained childish in spirit, and affairs of state came hard to him. Now that he
had taken the throne, Marie was no longer the regent and theoretically had

himself indispensable to his new master. All the previous premiers, under

standing the king’s childishness, had tried to keep him out of trouble; the

shrewd Richelieu played him differently, deliberately pushing him into

project after another,

such

as

a

against the

Huguenots and finally an extended war with Spain. The immensity of
these projects only made the king more dependent on his powerful pre-

mier, the only man able to keep order in the realm. And so, for the next

eighteen years, Richelieu, exploiting the king’s weaknesses, governed and
molded France according to his own vision, unifying the country and making it a strong European power for centuries to come.
lntcipretation
Richelieu saw everything as a military campaign, and no strategic move
was more
important to him than discovering his enemy’s weaknesses and
applying pressure to them. As early as his speeoh in 1615, he was looking
for the weak link in the chain of power, and he saw that it was the queen
mother, Not that Marie was obviously weakmslie governed both France
and her son; but Richelieu saw that she was really an insecure woman who
needed constant masculine attention. He showered her with afiection and

respect, even toadying up to her favorite, Concini. He knew the day would
come

when the king would take over, but he also recognized that Louis

loved his mother dearly and would always remain a child in relation to her.
The way to control Louis, then, was not by gaining his favor, which could

change overnight, but by gaining sway over his mother, for whom his afv
fection would never change.

Once Richelieu had the position he desiredm-prime minister———he discarded the queen mother, moving on to the next weak link in the chain:
the king‘s own character. There was a part of him that would always be a.

helpless child in need of higher authority. It was on the foundation of the
king’s weakness that Richelieu established his own power and fame.
Remember: When entering the court, find the weak link. The person
in control is often not the king or queen; it is someone behind the scenes-«
the favorite, the husband or wife, even the court fool. This person may
have more weaknesses than the king himself, because his power depends

capricious factors outside his control.
Finally, when dealing with helpless children who cannot make decisions, play on their weakness and push them into bold ventures, They will
have to depend on you even more, for you will become the adult figure
whom they rely on to get them out of scrapes and to safety.

how the Germans had developed it to undermine the British, how it had
supported the count for several years, and on and on. When Loller insisted
on a demonstration, the two men went to Lustig's room, where the count
produced a magnificent mahogany box fitted with slots, cranks, and dials.
Loller watched as Lustig inserted a. dollar bill in the box. Sure enough,
early the following morning Lustig pulled out two bills, still wet from the
chemicals.

Lustig gave the notes to Loller, who immediately took the bills to a
local bank—-——which accepted them as genuine. Now the businessman feverishly begged Lusug to sell him a machine. The count explained that there
was
only one in existence, so Loller made him a high offer: $25,000, then a
considerable amount (more than $400,000 in today’s terms). Even so,
Lustig seemed reluctant: He did not feel right about making his friend pay
so much. Yet
finally he agreed to the sale. After all, he said, “I suppose it
matters little what you pay me. You are, after all, going to recover the
amount within a few days by duplicating your own bills.” Making Loller

in

the smallest gesture. Loller, for instance, overtipped waiters, seemed

need for social validation and for

the respect that he thought his wealth had earned him. He was also chroni-

cally insecure. Luslig had come to the hotel to hunt for prey. In Loller he

psychic voids.
In offering Loller his friendship, then, Lustig knew he was offering him
the immediate respect of the other guests. As a count, Lustig was also offer276

And for the coup de grace, he apparently owned a machine that would rescue Loller from his worries. It would even put him on a par with Lustig
himself, who had also used the machine to maintain his status. No wonder
Loller took the bait.

Catherine had seen very early on the sway that a mistress has over a man
of power: Her own husband, Henri II, had kept one of the most infamous
mistresses of them all, Diane de Poitiers. What Catherine learned from the

experience was that a man like her husband wanted to feel he could win a
woman over without having to
rely on his status, which he had inherited
rather than earned. And such a need contained a huge blind spot: As long
as the woman

power over him, as Diane de Poitiers did over Henri. It was Catherine’s
strategy to turn this weakness to her advantage, using it as a way to conquer
and control men. All she had to do was unleash the loveliest women in the
court, her “flying squadron,” on men whom she knew shared her hus«

Interpretation
joseph Duveen instantly understood Arabella Huntington and what made
her tick: She wanted to feel important, at home in society. lntensely insecure about her lowerclass background, she needed confirmation of her
new social smtus. Duveen waited. lnstead of rushing into trying to persuade her to collect art, he subtly went to work on her weaknesses. He
made her feel that she deserved his attention not because she was the wife
of one of the wealthiest men in the world but because of her own special

character--and this completely melted her. Duveen never condescended
to Arabella; rather than lecturing to her, he instilled his ideas in her indi-

rectly. The result was one of his best and most devoted clients, and also the
sale of The Bhze Bay.
People’s need for validation and recognition, their need to feel impor~
tant, is the best kind of weakness to exploit. First, it is almost universal; second, exploiting it is so very easy. All you have to do is find ways to make

In 1862 King William of Prussia named Otto Von Bismarck premier and
minister for foreign affairs. Bismarck was known for his boldness, his a.rnbi~

tion—~and his interest in strengthening the military. Since Wflliam was surrounded by liberals in his ghvemment and cabinet, politicians who already
wanted to limit his powers, it was quite dangerous for him to put Bismarck
in this sensitive position. His wife, Queen Augusta, had tried to dissuade

him, but although she usually got her way with him, this time William
stuck to his guns.

Only a week after becoming prime minister, Bismarck made an impromptu speech to a few dozen ministers to convince them of the need to
enlarge the army. He ended by saying, “The great questions of the time
will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions of majorities, but by iron
and blood.” His speech was immediately disseminated throughout Ger-

knew he had blundered, and should have tempered his fiery words. Yet as
he contemplated his strategy, he decided not to apologize but to do the
exact opposite, Bismarck knew the king well.

When the two men met, William, predictably, had been worked into a
tizzy by the queen. He reiterated his fear of being guillotined. But Bismarck
only replied, “Yes, then we shall be dead! We must die sooner or later, and
could there be a more respectable way of dying? I should die lighting for
the cause of my king and master. Your Majesty would die sealing with your

blood your royal rights granted by God’s graze. Whether upon the

head of the army. How could the king allow people to push him around?
Wasn’t the honor of Germany more important than quibbling over words?
Not only did the prime minister convince the king to stand up to both his
wife and his parliament, he persuaded him to build up the am1y—Bismatclwfs goal all along.
Interpretation
Bismarck knew the king felt bullied by those around him. He knew that
William had a military background and a deep sense of honor, and that he
felt ashamed at his cravenness before his wife and his government. Wdliam

secretly yearned to be a great and mighty king, but he dared not express
this ambition because he was afraid of ending up like Louis XVI. Where a
show of courage often conceals a man’s timidity, William’s timidity concealed his need to show courage and thump his chest.
Bismarck sensed the longing for glory beneath William’s pacifist front,
so he
played to the king’s insecurity about his manhood, finally pushing
him into three wars and the creation of a German empire. Timidity is a. potent weakness to exploit. Timid souls often yearn to be their opposite——to
be Napoleons. Yet they lack the inner strength. You, in essence, can become their
Napoleon, pushing them into bold actions that serve your
needs while also making them dependent on you. Remember: Look to the
opposites and never take appearances at face value.

Playing on people’s weakness has one significant danger: You may stir up
an action you cannot control.

In your games of power you always look several steps ahead and plan
accordingly. And you exploit the fact that other people are more emotional
and incapable of such foresight. But when you play on their vulnerabilities,
the areas over which they have least control, you can unleash emotions
that will upset your plans. Push timid people into bold action and they may
go too far; answer their need for attention or recognition and they may
need more than you want to give them. The helpless, childish element you
are playing on can turn against you.
The more emotional the weakness, the greater the potential danger.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW

In July of 1830, a revolution broke out in Paris that forced the king,

z'\/ever [are your

Charles X, to abdicate. A commission of the highest authorities in the land

gathered to choose a successor, and the man they picked was LouisPhilippe, the Duke of Orleans.
From the beginning it was clear that Louis~Philippe would be a differ
am kind of king, and not just because he came from a different branch of
the royal family, or because he had not inherited the crown but had been
given it, by a commission, putting his legitimacy in question. Rather it was
that he disliked ceremony and the trappings of royalty; he had more
friends among the bankers than among the nobility; and his style was not
to create a new kind of royal rule, as Napoleon had done, but to downplay
his status, the better to mix with the businessmen and middle-class folk
who had called him to lead. Thus the symbols that came to be associated
with Louis-Philippe were neither the scepter nor the crown, but the gray
hat and umbrella with which he would proudly walk the streets of Paris, as
if he were a bourgeois out for a stroll. VVhen Louis—Philippe invited James

Rothschild, the most important banker in France, to his palace, he treated
him as an equal. And unlike any king before him, not only did he talk business with Monsieur Rothschild but that was literally all he talked, for he
loved money and had amassed a huge fortune.
As the reign of the “bourgeois king” plodded on, people came to de
spire him. The aristocracy could not endure the sight of an unkingly king,

and within a few years they turned on him. Meanwhile the growing class of
the poor, including the radicals who had chased out Charles X, found no
satisfaction in a ruler who neither acted as a king nor governed as a man of

the people. The bankers to whom Louis-Philippe was the most beholden
soon realized that it was
they who controlled the country, not he, and they
treated him with growing contempt. One day, at the start of a train trip organized for the royal family, James Rothschild actually berated him-and
iri public-—for being late. Once the king had made news by treating the
banker as an equal; now the banker treated the king as an inferior.
Eventually the workers’ insurrections that had brought down LouisPhi1ippe’s predecessor began to ree.-merge, and the king put them down
with force. But what was he defending so brutally? Not the institution of the
monarchy, which he disdained, nor a democratic republic, which his rule
prevented. What he was really defending, it seemed, was his own fortune,
and the fortunes of the bankers—-not a way to inspire loyalty among the

citizenry.
In early 1848, Frenchmen of all classes began to demonstrate for electoral reforms that would make the country truly democratic. By February

the demonstrations had turned violent. To assuage the populace, Louis-

Philippe fired his prime minister and appointed a liberal as a replacement.
But this created the opposite of the desired effect: The people sensed they
could push the king around. The demonstrations turned into a l'ull~fledged
revolution, with gunfire and barricades in the streets.

LAW 34

On the night of February 23, a crowd of Parisians surrounded the

palace. With a suddenness that caught everyone by surprise, LouisPhilippe abdicated that very evening and fled to England. He left no sue»
cessor, nor even the suggestion of one-—his whole government folded up
and dissolved like a traveling circus leaving town.
Interpretation

Louis-Philippe consciously dissolved the aura that natu.rally pertains to
kings and leaders. Scoffing at the symbolism of grandeur, he believed a
new world was
dawning, where rulers should act and be like ordinary citi
zens. He was right: A new world, without
kings and queens, was certainly

profoundly
the dynamics of power.
The bourgeois king’s hat and umbrella amused the French at first, but
soon
grew irritating. People knew that Louis-Philippe was not really like
them at all—that the hat and umbrella were essentially a kind of trick to encourage them in the fantasy that the country had suddenly grown more
equal. Actually, though, the divisions of wealth had never been greater.
The French expected their ruler to be a bit of a showman, to have some
presence. Even a radical like Robespierre, who had briefly come to power
during the French Revolution fifty years earlier, had understood this, and
cenainly Napoleon, who had turned the revolutionary republic into an im
per-ial regime, had known it in his bones. Indeed as soon as Louis—Phi1ippe
fled the stage, the French revealed their true desire: They elected
Napoleon’s grand-nephew president. He was a virtual unknown, but they
hoped he would recreate the great general’s powerful aura, erasing the
awkward memory of the “bourgeois king.”
Powerful people may be tempted to affect a common-man aura, trying
to create the illusion that they and their subjects or underlings are basically
the same. But the people whom this false gesture is intended to impress will
quickly see through it. They understand that they are not being given more
power——that it only appears as if they shared in the powerful person’s fate.
The only kind of common touch that works is the kind ailected by Franklin
Roosevelt, a style that said the president shared values and goals with the
people even while he remained a patrician at heart. He never
pretended to erase his distance from the crowd.
Leaders who try to dissolve that distance through a false chumrniness
gradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love. Instead they elicit
contempt. Like Louis—Philippe, they are too uninspiring even to be worth
the guillotine-——the best they can do is simply vanish in the night, as if they

Genoa, settled in Lisbon. Using the fabricated story of his noble back
ground, he married into an established Lisbon family that had excellent
connections with Portuguese royalty.
Through his in—laws, Columbus finagled a meeting with the king of
Portugahjoao II, whom he petitioned to finance a westward voyage aimed
at discovering a shorter route to Asia. In return for announcing that any
discoveries he achieved would be made in the kings name, Columbus
Ihwanted a series of rights: the title Grand Admiral of the Oceanic Sea; the
office of Viceroy over any lands he found; and 10 percent of the future
commerce with such lands. All of these rights were to be hereditary and for
all time. Columbus made these demands even though he had previously
been a mere merchant, he knew almost nothing about navigation, he could
not work a quadrant, and he had never led a group of men. In short he had
absolutely no qualifications for the journey he proposed. Furthermore, his
petition included no details as to how he would accomplish his plans, just
vague promises.
“Then Columbus finished his pitch, joao II smiled: He politely declined the offer, but left the door open for the future. Here Columbus must
have noticed something he would never forget: Even as the king turned
down the sailor’s demands, he treated them as

legitimate. He neither
laughed at Columbus nor questioned his background and credentials. In
fact the king was impressed by the boldness of Columbus’s requests, and
clearly felt comfortable in the company of a man who acted so confidently.
The meeting must have convinced Columbus that his instincts were cor‘
rect: By asking for the moon, he had instantly raised his own status, for the

king assumed that unless a man who set such a high price on himself were
mad, which Columbus did not appear to be, he must somehow be worth it.
A few years later Columbus moved to Spain. Using his Portuguese
connections, he moved in elevated circles at the Spanish court, receiving
subsidies from illustrious financiers and sharing tables with dukes and
princes. To all these men be repeated his request for financing for a voyage

ambitious voyage the following year, she agreed. By then
she had come to see Columbus as destined for great things.

Interpretation
As an explorer Columbus was mediocre at best. He knew less about the
sea than did the average sailor on his

ships, could never determine the lati-

tude and longitude of his discoveries, mistook islands for vast continents,
and treated his crew badly. But in one area he was a genius: He knew how
to sell himself. How else to explain how the son of a cheese vendor, a. low-

level sea merchant, managed to ingratiate himself with the highest royal
and aristocratic families?
Columbus had an amazing power to charm the nobility, and it all
came from the way he carried himself. He

projected a sense of confidence

that was completely out of proportion to his means. Nor was his confidence
the aggressive, ugly selfipromotion of an upsmrt—it was a quiet and calm

selflassurance. In fact it was the same confidence usually shown by the no
bility themselves. The powerful in the o1d—style aristocracies felt no need to
prove or assert themselves; being noble, they knew they always deserved
more, and asked for it. With Columbus, then, they felt an instant aflinity,
for he carried himself just the way they clid——elevated above the crowd,
destined for greatness.
Understand: It is within your power to set your own price. How you
carry yourself reflects what you think of yourself. If you ask for little, shuffle your feet and lower your head, people will assume this reflects your
character. But this behavior is not you»-—it is only how you have chosen to

present yourself to other people. You can just as easily present the Colum~

The Strategy of the Crown is based on a simple chain of cause and effect: If we believe we are destined for great things, our belief will radiate
outward, just as a crown creates an aura around a king. This outward radiance will infect the
people around us, who will think we must have reasons
to feel so confident. People who wear crowns seem to feel no inner sense of
the limits to what they can ask for or what they can accomplish. This too
radiates outward. Limits and boundaries disappear. Use the Strategy of the
Crown and you will be surprised how often it bears fruit. Take as an exa.m~
ple those happy children who ask for whatever they want, and get it. Their
high expectations are their charm. Adults enjoy granting their wishes-——just
as Isabella
enjoyed granting the wishes of Columbus.
Throughout history, people of undistinguished birth-—-the Theodora: of
Byzantium, the Columbuses, the Beethovens, the Disraelis-——-have managed
to work the
Strategy of the Crown, believing so firmly in their own greatness
that it becomes a seIf~fulfil1ing prophecy. The trick is simple: Be overcome
by your selfibelief. Even while you know you are practicing a kind of deception on yourself, act like a king. You are likely to be treated as one.
The crown may separate you from other people, but it is up to you to
make that separation real: You have to act differently, demonstrating your
distance from those around you. One way to emphasize your difference is
to always act with dignity, no matter the circumstance. Louis~Philippe gave
no sense of being different from other
people—he was the banker king.
And the moment his subjects threatened him, he caved in. Everyone
sensed this and pounced. Lacking regal dignity and firmness of purpose,
Louis-Philippe seemed an impostor, and the crown was easily toppled

LAW :54

Haile Selassie, ruler of Ethiopia for forty or so years beginning in 1930,
was once a young man named

Lij Tafari. He came from a noble family, but

there was no real chance of him coming to power, for he was far down the

line of succession from the king then on the throne, Menelik II. Neverthe-

less, from an early age he exhibited a self~coufidence and a royal bearing
that surprised everyone around him.
At the age of fourteen, Tafari went to live at the court, where he imme—

diately impressed Menelik and became his favorite. Tafarfs grace under
fire, his patience, and his calm selflassurance fascinated the king. The other
young nobles, arrogant, blustery, and envious, would push this slight,
bookish teenager around. But he never got angry-—-that would have been a
sign of insecurity, to which he would not stoop. There were already people
around him who felt he would someday rise to the top, for he acted as if he
were already there.
Years later, in 1936, when the Italian Fascists had taken over Ethiopia
and Tafari, now called Haile Selassie, was in exile, he addressed the League
of Nations to plead his country’s case. The Italians in the audience heckled
him with vulgar abuse, but he maintained his dignified pose, as if completely unaffected. This elevated him while making his opponents look
even
uglier. Dignity, in fact, is invariably the mask to assume under difficult
circumstances: It is as if nothing can affect you, and you have all the time
in the world to respond. This is an extremely powerful pose.
A royal demeanor has other uses. Con artists have long known the
value of an aristocratic front; it either disazms people and makes them less
suspicious, or else it intimidates them and puts them on the defensive———and
as Count Victor
Lustig knew, once you put a sucker on the defensive he is
doomed. The con man Yellow Kid Well, too, would often assume the trap
pings of a man of wealth, along with the nonchalance that goes with them.
Alluding to some magical method of making money, he would stand aloof,
like a king, exuding confidence as if he really were fabulously rich. The
suckers would beg to be in on the con, to have a chance at the wealth that
he so clearly displayed.

Finally, to reinforce the inner psychological tricks involved in projecting royal demeanor, there are outward strategies to help you create the
effect. First, the Columbus Strategy: Always make a bold demand. Set your
price high and do not waver. Second, in a dignified way, go after the highest person in the building. This immediately puts you on the same plane as
the chief executive you are attacking. It is the David and Goliath Strategy:
a

By choosing a great opponent, you create the appearance of greatness.
Third, give a gift of some sort to those above you. This is the strategy
of those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you are essentially
saying that the two of you are equal. It is the old con game of giving so that
you can take. When the Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino wanted the
Duke of Mantua as his nerd patron, he knew that if he was slavish and

sycophantic, the duke would think him unworthy; so he approached the
duke with gifts, in this case paintings by the wn‘ter’s good friend Titian.
288

LAW 34

Accepting the gifts created a kind of equality between duke and writer: The
duke was put at ease by the feeling that he was dealing with a man of his
own aristocratic stamp. He funded Aretino
generously. The gift strategy is
subtle and brilliant because you do not beg: You ask for help in a dignified
way that implies equality between two people, one of whom just happens
to have more money.

Remember: It is up to you to set your own price. As}: for less and that
is just what you will get Ask for more, however, and you send a signal that

you are worth a king’s ransom. Even those who turn you down respect you
for your confidence, and that respect will eventually pay off in ways you
cannot imagine.

Image: The Crown. Place it upon your head
and you assume a different pose——tranqui1

yet radiating assurance. Never show

the crown, or it will not fit. It will seem
to be destined for one more

The idea behind the assumption of regal confidence is to set yourself apart
from other people, but if you take this too far it will be your undoing.
Never make the mistake of thinking that you elevate yourself by humiliat-

ing people. Also, it is never a good idea to loom too high above the

crowcl—you make an easy target. And there are times when an aristocratic
pose is eminently dangerous.
Charles I, king of England during the 16405, faced a profound public
disenchantment with the institution of monarchy. Revolts erupted through»
out the country, led by Oliver Cromwell. Had Charles reacted to the times
with insight, supporting reforms and making a show of sacrificing some of
his power, history might have been different. Instead he reverted to an
even more regal pose, seeming outraged by the assault on his
power and

Understand: You are radiating confidence, not arrogance or disdain.
Finally, it is true that you can sometimes find some power through affecting a kind of earthy vulgarity, which will prove amusing by its extremeness. But to the extent that
you win this game by going beyond the limits,
separating yourself from other people by appearing even more vulgar than
they are, the game is dangerous: There will always be people more vulgar
than you, and you will easily be replaced the following season by someone
younger and worse.

Starting out in life as a nondescript French seminary-school teacher, Joseph
Fouché wandered from town to town for most of the decade of the 17805,

teaching mathematics to young boys. Yet he never completely committed
himself to the church, never took his vows as a pn'est—he had bigger plans.
Patiently waiting for his chance, he kept his options open. And when the
French Revolution broke out, in 1789, Fouché waited no longer: He got rid
of his cassock, grew his hair long, and became a revolutionary. For this was
the spirit of the times. To miss the boat at this critical moment could have
spelt disaster. Fouché did not miss the boat: Befriending the revolutionary
leader Robespierre, he quickly rose in the rebel ranks. In 1792 the town of
Nantes elected Fouché to be its representative to the National Convention
(created that year to frame a new constitution for a French republic).

His sense of timing was uncanny. He started as a moderate, for moderv

he oversaw the execution of dozens of aristocrats. At a certain moment,

however, he called a halt to the killings, sensing that the mood of the counny was turning—and despite the blood already on his hands, the citizens of

Lyons hailed him as a savior from what had become known as the Terror.
So far Fouché had played his cards brilliantly, but in 1794 his old
friend Robespierre recalled him to Paris to account for his actions in Lyons.
Robespierre had been the driving force behind the Terror. He had sent
heads on both the right and the left rolling, and Fouché, whom he no
longer trusted, seemed destined to provide the next head. Over the next
few weeks, a tense struggle ensued: While Robespierre railed openly
against Fouché, accusing of him dangerous ambitions and calling for his ar»
rest, the crafty Fouché worked more indirectly, quietly gaining support
among those who were beginning to tire of Robespierre’s dictatorial control. Fouché was playing for time. He knew that the longer he survived, the
more disaffected citizens he could
rally against Robespierre. He had to
have broad support before he moved against the powerful leader. He rallied support among both the moderates and the jacobins, playing on the
widespread fear of Robespierre-—everyone was afraid of being the next to
go to the guillotine. It all came to fruition on July 27: The convention

turned against Robespierre, shouting down his usual lengthy speech. He
was

quickly arrested, and a few days later it was Robespierre’s head, not

Fouché’s, that fell ‘into the basket.
Wlhen Fouché returned to the convention after Robespien-e’s death, he

played his most unexpected move:

Having led the conspiracy against

Robespierre, he was expected to sit with the moderates, but lo and behold,
he once again changed sides, joining the radical Jacobins. For perhaps the
first time in his life he aligned himself with the minority. Clearly he sensed
a reaction

stirring: He knew that the moderate faction that had executed

Robespierre, and was now about to take power, would initiate a new round
of the Terror, this time against the radicals. In siding with the jacobins,
then, Fouché was sitting with the martyrs of the days to eome—the people
who would be considered blameless in the troubles that were on their way.

Taking sides with what was about to become the losing team was a risky
gambit, of course, but Fouché must have calculated he could keep his head
long enough to quietly stir up the populace against the moderates and
watch them fall from power. And indeed, although the moderates did call
for his arrest in December of 1795, and would have sent him to the guillo~
line, too much time had passed. The executions had become unpopular
with the people, and Fouché survived the swing of the pendulum one more
time.

A new government took over, the Directoire. It was not, however, a

jacobin government, but a moderate one-———more moderate than the gov‘
emment that had reimposed the Terror. Fouché, the radical, had kept his
head, but now he had to keep a low profile. He waited patiently on the
sidelines for several years, allowing time to soften any bitter feelings
against him, then he approached the Directoire and convinced them he
had a new passion: intelligencegathering. He became a paid spy for the

was
kept on a tight leash—it publicized a growing discontent with the emperor, who seemed to be losing control. By 1814 Napoleon’s power had
crumbled and allied forces finally conquered him.
The next government was a restoration of the monarchy, in the form
of King Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI. Fouché, his nose always sniffing the air for the next social shift, knew Louis would not last long—he had
none of
Napoleon's flair. Fouché once again played his waiting game, lying
low, staying away from the spotlight. Sure enough, in February of 1815,
Napoleon escaped from the island of Elba, where he had been imprisoned.
Louis XVIII panicked: His policies had alienated the citizenry, who were
clamoring for Nap0leon’s return. So Louis turned to the one man who
could maybe have saved his hide, Fouché, the former radical who had sent
his brother, Louis XVI, to the guillotine, but was now one of the most popular and widely admired politicians in France. Fouché, however, would not
side with a loser: He refused Louis’s request for help by pretending that his
help was unnecessaiy—by swearing that Napoleon would never return
to power (although he knew otherwise). A short time later, of course,
Napoleon and his new citizen army were closing in on Paris.
Seeing his reign about to collapse, feeling that Fouché had betrayed
him, and certain that he did not want this powerful and able man on
Napoleon’s team, King Louis ordered the Ini.n.ister’s arrest and execution.
On March 16, 1815, policemen surrounded Fouché’s coach on a Paris
boulevard. Was this finally his end? Perhaps, but not immediately: Fouché
told the police that an exvmember of government could not be arrested on
the street. They fell for the story and allowed him to retum home. Later
that day, though, they came to his house and once again declared him
under arrest. Fouché nodded—but would the officers be so kind as allow a

gentleman to wash and to change his clothes before leaving his house for
the last time? They gave their permission, Fouché left the room, and the
minutes went by. Fouché did not return. Finally the policemen went into
the next room—where they saw a ladder against an open window, leading
down to the garden below.
That day and the next the police combed Paris for Fouché, but by then
Napoleon’s cannons were audible in the distance and the king and all the
king’s men had to flee the city. As soon as Napoleon entered Paris, Fouché

Interpretation
In a period of unprecedented turmoil, Joseph Fouché thrived through his

mastery of the art of timing. He teaches us a number of key lessons.

First, it is critical to recognize the spirit of the times. Fouché always
looked two steps ahead, found the wave that would carry him to power,
and rode it. You must always work with the times, anticipate twists and
turns, and never miss the boat. Sometimes the spirit of the times is obscure:

Recognize it not by what is loudest and most obvious in it, but by what lies
hidden and dormant. Look forward to die Napoleons of the future rather
than holding on to the ruins of the past.
Second, recognizing the prevailing winds does not necessarily mean
running with them. Any potent social movement creates a powerful reaction, and it is wise to anticipate what that reaction will be, as Fouché did
after the execution of Robespierre. Rather than ride the cresting wave of

As they started out, however, the sun was setting. Afraid of being

took them many minutes to put the packet together again, and by the time

they had reached the city gates, it was too late.
When you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a nest
of problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much longer than if
you had taken your time. Hurriers may occasionally get there quicker, but
papers fly everywhere, new dangers arise, and they find themselves in constant crisis mode, fixing the problems that they themselves have created.

Waiting involves controlling not only your own emotions but those of
your colleagues, who, mistaking acfion for power, may try to push you into
making rash moves. In your rivals, on the other hand, you can encourage

stand back and wait, you will soon find ripe moments to intervene and pick
up the pieces. This wise policy was the principal strategy of the great earlyseventeenthcentury emperor Tokugawa Ieyasu of japan. When his prede~
cessor, the headstrong Hideyoshi, whom he served as 3. general, staged a
rash invasion of Korea, leyasu did not involve himself. He knew the invasion would be a disaster and would lead to Hideyoshfs downfall, Better to

anistry.
You do not deliberately slow time down to live longer, or to take more

pleasure in the moment, but the better to play the game of power. First,
when your mind is uncluttered by constant emergencies you will see fur»
ther into the future. Second, you will be able to resist the baits that people

dangle in front of you, and will keep yourself from becoming another im~
patient sucker. Third, you will have more room to be flexible. Opportunities will inevitably arise that you had not expected and would have missed

had you forced the pace. Fourth, you will not move from one deal to the
next without

completing the first one. To build your power’s foundation

can take years; make sure that foundation is secure. Do not be a flash in the

pan—-«success that is built up slowly and surely is the only kind that lasts.
Finally, slowing time down will give you a perspective on the times
you live in, letting you take a certain distance and putting you in a less
emotionally charged position to see the shapes of things to come. Hurriers
will often mistake surface phenomena for a real trend, seeing only what

they want to see. How much better to see what is really happening, even if
it is unpleasant or makes your task harder.

Forced Time. The trick in forcing time is to upset the timing of others-——t0

make them hurry, to make them wait, to make them abandon their own
pace, to distort their perception of time. By upsetting the timing of your op~
ponent while you stay patient, you open up time for yourself, which is half
the game.
In 1473 the great Turkish sultan Mehmed the Conqueror invited negotiations with Hungary to end the elf-andam war the two countries had

waged for years. When the Hungarian emissary arrived in Turkey to start
the talks, Turkish officials humbly apologized——Mehmed had just left Istanbul, the capital, to battle his longtime foe, Uzun Hasan. But he urgently
wanted peace with Hungary, and had asked that the emissary join him at
the front.

When the emissary anived at the site of the fighting, Mehmed had al-

ready left it, moving eastward in pursuit of his swift foe. This happened
several times. Wherever the emissary stopped, the Thrks lavished gifts and
banquets on him, in pleasurable but timeconsuming ceremonies. Finally
Mehrned defeated Uzun and met with the emissary. Yet his terms for peace
with Hungary were excessively harsh. After a few days, the negotiations

ended, and the usual stalemate remained in place. But this was fine with
Mehmecl. In fact he had planned it that way all along: Plotting his cam-

paign against Uzun, he had seen that diverting his armies to the east would
leave his western flank vulnerable. To prevent Hungary from taking advan»
tage of his weakness and his preoccupation elsewhere, he flrst dangled the
lure of peace before his enemy, then made them wait»-all on his own
terms.

Making people wait is a powerful way of forcing time, as long as they
do not figure out what you are up to. You control the clock, they linger in
limbowand rapidly come unglued, opening up opportunities for you to
strike. The opposite effect is equally powerful: You make your opponents
hurry. Start off your dealings with them slowly, then suddenly apply pressure,

making them feel that everything is happening at once. People who

lack the time to think will make mistakes-—so set their deadlines for them.

This was the technique Machiavelli admired in Cesare Borgia, who, during

negotiations, would suddenly press vehemently for a decision, upsetting
his opponent’s timing and patience. For who would dare make Cesare
wait?

Joseph Duveen, the famous art dealer, knew that if he gave an indecisive buyer like John D. Rockefeller a deadline»-the painting had to leave
the country, another tycoon was interested in it—the client would buy just
in time. Freud noticed that patients who had spent years in psychoanalysis
without improvement would miraculously recover just in time if he fixed a
definite date for the end of the therapy. Jacques Lacan, the famous French

psychoanalyst, used a variation on this tactic—he would sometimes end
the customary hour session of therapy after only ten minutes, without

warning. After this happened several times, the patient would realize that
he had better make maximum use of the time, rather than wasting much of
the hour with a lot of talk that meant nothing. The deadline, then, is a powerful tool. Close off the vistas of indecision and force people to make up

their damn minds or get to the point—never let them make you play on
their excruciating terms. Never give them time.

Magicians and showmen are experts in forcing time. Houdini could
often wriggle free of handcuffs in minutes, but he would draw the escape
out to an hour, making the audience sweat, as time came to an apparent

standstill. Magicians have always known that the best way to alter our pet-

ception of time is often to slow down the pace. Creating suspense brings
time to a terrifying pause: The slower the magician’s hands move, the easier it is to create the illusion of speed, making people think the rabbit has

appeared instantaneously. The great nineteenthcentury magician _]ean—Eu—
gene Robert~Houdin took explicit notice of this effect: “The more slowly a
story is told,” he said, “the shorter it seems.”
Going slower also makes wha). you are doing more interesting»-the
audience yields to your pace, becomes entranced. It is a state in which time
whizzes delightfully by. You must practice such illusions, which share in the

hypnotisfs power to alter perceptions of time.
End Time. You can play the game with the utmost artistry—--waiting pa-

tiently for the right moment to act, putting your competitors off their form
by messing with their timing~—-but it won’t mean a thing unless you know
how to finish. Do not be one of those people who look like paragons of pa«
tieuce but are actually just afraid to bring things to a close: Patience is
worthless unless combined with a willingness to fall ruthlessly on your opponent at the right moment. You can wait as long as necessary for the con
clusion to come, but when it comes it must come quickly. Use speed to
paralyze your opponent, cover up any mistakes you might make, and impress people with your aura of authority and finality.
With the patience of a snake charmer, you draw the snake out with
calm and steady rhythms. Once the snake is out, though, would you dangle

your foot above its deadly head? There is never a good reason to allow the

judged by how you work with end time——-how you quickly change the pace
and bring things to a swift and definitive conclusion.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
The Mexican rebel leader Pancho Villa started out as the chief of a gang of

bandits, but after revolution broke out in Mexico in 1910, he became a.
kind of folk hero—robbing trains and giving the money to the poor, lead
ing daring raids, and charming the ladies with romantic escapades. His exploits fascinated Americans—he seemed a man from another era, part
Robin Hood, part Don Juan. After a few years of bitter fighting, however,
General Carranza emerged as the victor in the Revolution; the defeated
Villa and his troops went back home, to the northern state of Chihuahua.
His army dwindled and he turned to banditry again, damaging his popularity. Finally, perhaps out of desperation, he began to rail against the
United States, the gringos, whom he blamed for his troubles.
In March of 1916, Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico. Ram»
paging through the town, he and his gang killed seventeen American soldiers and civilians. President Woodrow Wilson, like many Americans, had
admired Villa; now, however, the bandit needed to be punished. Wilson’s
advisers urged him to send troops into Mexico to capture Villa. For a
power as large as the United States, they argued, not to strike back at an
army that had invaded its territory would send the worst kind of signal.
Furthermore, they continued, many Americans saw Wilson as a pacifist, a
principle the public doubted as a response to violence; he needed to prove
his mettle and manliness by ordering the use of force.
The pressure on Wflson was strong, and before the month was out,
with the approval of the Carranza government, he sent an army of ten

it focused attention on the Americans’ incompetence and on Villa’s

started it all. As a minor annoyance became an international embarrassment, and the enraged Americans dispatched more troops, the imbalance

Expedition did the opposite of what it set out to do: It left Villa not only
free but more popular than ever.
What could Wilson have done differently? He could have pressured
the Carranza government to catch Villa for him. Alternatively, since many
Mexicans had tired of Villa before the Punitive Expedition began, he could
have worked quietly with them and won their support for a much smaller
raid to capture the bandit. He could have organized a trap on the American side of die

the matter altogether for the time being, waiting for the Mexicans them-

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the year 1527, King Henry VIII of England decided he had to find a
way to get rid of his wife, Catherine of Aragon. Catherine had failed to produce a son, a male heir who would ensure the continuance of his dynasty,

and Henry thought he knew why: He had read in the Bible the passage,
“And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath
uncovered his brother‘s nakedness; they shall be childless.” Before marry

ing Henry, Catherine had married his older brother Arthur, but Arthur
had died five months later. Henry had waited an appropriate time, then
had married his brother’s widow.

he could not have done had he considered it incestuous. Yet after years of

marriage to Henry, Catherine had failed to produce a son, and in the early
1520s she had entered menopause. To the king this could only mean one

thing: She had lied about her virginity, their union was incesmous, and
God had punished them.
There was another reason why Henry wanted to get rid of Catherine:
He had fallen in love with a younger woman, Anne Boleyn. Not only was
he in love with her, but if he married her he could still hope to sire a legitimate son. The marriage to Catherine had to be annulled. For this, however,

Henry had to apply to the Vatican. But Pope Clement would never

annul the marriage,

By the summer of 1527, rumors spread throughout Europe that Henry
about to attempt the impossible-—to annul his marriage against
Clement’s wishes. Catherine would never abdicate, let alone voluntarily
enter a
nunnery, as Henry had urged her. But Henry had his own strategy:
He stopped sleeping in the same bed with Catherine, since he considered
her his sister~in-law, not his lawful wife. He insisted on calling her Princess

simply ignored him. Clement fumed—no one had ever treated him so contemptuously. Henry had humiliated him and he had no power of recourse.
Even excommunication (which he constantly threatened but never camed

Catherine too felt the devastating sting of Henry’s disdain. She tried to
fight back, but in appealing to Henry her words fell on deaf ears, and soon
they fell on no one’s. Isolated from the court, ignored by the king, mad
with anger and frustration, Catherine slowly deteriorated, and finally died

Vllhen you pay attention to a person, the two of you become partners of
sorts, each moving in step to the actions and reactions of the other. In the

process you lose your initiative. It is a dynamic of all interactions: By acknowledging other people, even if only to fight with them, you open yourself to their influence. Had Henry locked horns with Catherine, he would
have found himself mired in endless arguments that would have weakened
his resolve and eventually worn him down. (Catherine was a strong, stubbom woman.) Had he set out to convince Clement to change his verdict on

KEYS TO POWER

Desire often creates paradoxical effects: The more you want something,
the more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. The more interest you

show, the more you repel the object of your desire. This is because your in«
terest is too su~ong—--it makes people awkward, even fearful. Uncontrollable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic.
You need to turn your back on what you want. show your contempt
and disdain. This is the kind of powerful response that will drive your tar-

play by your rules (see Laws 8 and 39 on baiting people into action).
Contempt is the prerogative of the king. Where his eyes turn, what he
decides to see, is what has reality; what he ignores and turns his back on is
as good as dead. That was the weapon of King Louis XlV—-if he did not
like you, he acted as if you were not there, maintaining his superiority by
cutting off the dynamic of interaction. This is the power you have when
you play the card of contempt, periodically showing people that you can
do without them.
If choosing to ignore enhances your power, it follows that the opposite

approach-—commitment and engagement--ofien weakens you. By paying
undue attention to a puny enemy, you look puny, and the longer it takes
you to crush such an enemy, the larger the enemy seems. When Athens set
out to conquer the island of Sicily, in 415 B.C., 3, giant power was attacking a
tiny one. Yet by entangling Athens in a long—drawn—out conflict, Syracuse,
Sicily’s most important city-state, was able to grow in stature and confi»
dence. Finally defeating Athens, it made itself famous for centuries to
come. In recent times, President
john F. Kennedy made a similar mistake
in his attitude to Fidel Castro of Cuba: His failed invasion at the Bay of

A second danger: If you succeed in crushing the irritant, or even if you
merely wound it, you create sympathy for the weaker side. Critics of
Franklin D. Roosevelt complained bitterly about the money his administration spent on government projects, but their attacks had no resonance
with the public, who saw the president as working to end the Great De~
pression. His opponents thought they had an example that would show just
how wasteful he had become: his dog, Fala, which he lavished with favors
and attention. Critics railed at his insensifivitywspendmg taxpayers‘
money on a dog while so many Americans were still in poverty. But Roosevelt had a response: How dare his critics attack a defenseless little dog?

His speech in defense of Fala was one of the most popular he ever gave. In
this case, the weak party involved was the president’s dog and the attack

backfired-in the long run, it only made the president more sympathetic,
since many people will naturally side with the “underdog,” just as the
American public came to sympathize with the wily but outnumbered Pancho Villa.

often make them. It is sometimes more politic to leave them

group of government documents about the history of US. involvement in
Indochina, Henry Kissinger erupted into a volcanic rage. Furious about the
Nixon administi-ation’s vulnerability to this kind of damaging leak, he

made recommendations that eventually led to the formation of a group

called the Plumbers to plug the leaks. This was the unit that later broke into
Democratic Party offices in the Watergate Hotel, setting off the chain of
events that led to Nixon’s downfall. In reality the publication of the Pentagon Papers was not a serious threat to the administration, but Kissingefs
reaction made it a big deal. In trying to fix one problem, he created another: a paranoia for security that in the end was much more destructive to
the government. Had he ignored the Pentagon Papers, the scandal they
had created would eventually have blown over.

powerful tactic is to act as if it never really interested you in the first
place. When the writer George Sand’s supporters nominated her to be the
first female member of the Académie Frangaise, in 1861, Sand quickly saw
that the academy would never admit her. Instead of whining, though, she
claimed she had no interest in belonging to this group of worn—out, overrated, outAof—touch windbags. Her disdain was the perfect response: Had
more

she shown her anger at her exclusion, she would have revealed how much
it meant to her. Instead she branded the academy a club of old mem-and

why should she be angry or disappointed at not having to spend her time
with them? Crying “sour grapes” is sometimes seen as a reflection of the
weak; it is actually the tactic of the powerful.
Second, when you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people’s attention by making it clear that the attack has not even registered. Look away,
or answer sweetly, showing how little the attack concerns you. Similarly,
when you yourself have committed a blunder, the best response is often to
make less of your mistake by treating it lightly

guest, Dainagon Tsunehiro. asked if he could carry the tea bowl into the
light, to examine it more closely. The bowl rarely left the table, but the emperor was in good spirits and he consented. As Dainagori carried the bowl
to the railing of the verandah, however, and held it up to the light, it

slipped from his hands and fell on a rock in the garden below, smashing
into tiny fragments.
The emperor of course was furious. “It was indeed most clumsy of me
to let it drop in this
way,” said Dainagon, with a deep how, “but really
there is not much harm done. This ldo tea~bowl is a very old one and it is

impossible to say how much longer it would have lasted, but anyhow it is
not a thing of any public use, so I think it rather fortunate that it has broken
thus.” This surprising response had an immediate effect: The emperor
calmed down. Dainagon neither sniveled nor overapologized, but signaled
his own worth and power by treating his mistake with a touch of disdain.
The emperor had to respond with a similar aristocratic indifference; his
anger had made him seem low and petty——an image Dainagon was able to

manipulate.
Among equals this tactic might bacldire: Your indifference could make
you seem callous. But with a master, if you act quickly and without great
fuss, it can work to great effect: You bypass his angry response, save him
the time and energy he would waste by brooding over it, and allow him the
opportunity to display his own lack of pettiness publicly.
If we make excuses and denials when we are caught in a mistake or a
deception, we stir the waters and make the situation worse. It is ofien wiser
to play things the opposite way. The Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino
often boasted of his aristocratic lineage, which was, of course, a fiction,
since he was actually the son of a shoemaker. When an enemy of his finally
revealed the embarrassing truth, word quiddy spread, and soon all of
Venice (where he lived at the time) was aghast at Aretino’s lies. Had he
tried to defend himself, he would have only dragged himself down. His response was masterful: He announced that he was indeed the son of a shoemaker, but this only proved his greatness, since he had risen from the
lowest stratum of society to its very pinnacle. From then on he never men-

tioned his previous lie, trumpeting instead his new position on the matter
of his ancestry.
Remember: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances and
irritations are contempt and disdain. Never show that something has af-

fected you, or that you are offended——that only shows you have acknowl-

edged a problem. Contempt is a dish that is best served cold and without
affectarion.

Authority: Know how to play the card of contempt. It is the most politic

There is no revenge like oblivion, for it is the entombment of the unwor-

REVERSAL
You must play the card of contempt with care and delicacy. Most small

troubles will vanish on their own if you leave them be; but some will grow
and fester unless you attend to them. Ignore a person of inferior stature and
the next time you look he has become a serious rival, and your contempt

has made him vengeful as well. The geat princes of Renaissance Italy
chose to ignore Cesare Borgia at the outset of his career as a young general
in the army of his father, Pope Alexander VI. By the time they paid a1ten~
tion it was too lat.e——the cub was now a lion, gobbling up chunks of Italy.

Often, then, while you show contempt publicly you will also need to keep
an
eye on the problem privately, monitoring its status and making sure it
goes away. Do not let it become a cancerous cell.
Develop the skill of sensing problems when they are still small and

taking care of them before they become intractable. Leam to distinguish
between the potentially disastrous and the mildly irritating, the nuisance
that will quietly go away on its own. In either case, though, never com—
pletely take your eye oil" it. As long as it is alive it can smolder and spark

In the early 1780s. word spread through Berlin of the strange and spectacu-

lar medical practice of a Dr. Weisleder. He performed his miracles in an
enormous

converted beer hall, outside which Berliners began to notice

longer lines of people—-the blind, the lame, anyone with an illness in
curable by normal medicine. When it leaked out that the doctor worked by
exposing the patient to the rays of the moon, he soon became dubbed The
ever

Moon Doctor of Berlin.

Sometime in 1783, it was reported that Dr. Weisleder had cured a well»
to—do woman of a terrible ailment. He suddenly became a celebrity. Previ~

ously only the poorest Berliners had been seen waiting outside the beer
hall in their rags; now magnificent carriages were parked outside, and gen-

tlemen in frock coats, and ladies with enormous coiffures, lined the street
as

sunset drew near. Even folk with the mildest of ailments came, out of

sheer curiosity, As they waited in line, the poorer clients would explain to
the gentlemen and ladies that the doctor only practiced when the moon
was in its increscent

phase. Many would add that they themselves had al

ready been exposed to the healing powers he called forth from the rays of
the moon. Even those who felt cured kept coming back, drawn by this

powerful experience.
Inside the beer hall, a strange and stirring spectacle greeted the visitor:

and then, after collecting his fee, send the boy and his father on their way.
Meanwhile, in the sout.h~faciug room, his wife would be doing the same

two places at once; it cannot have been visible, in other words, from both
windows. Apparently the mere thought, idea, and symbol of the moon
were enough, for the ladies did not complain, and would later remark
confidently that the wife of the Moon Doctor had the same healing powers

Interpretation
Dr Weislecler may have known nothing about medicine, but he under-

stood human nature. He recognized that people do not always want words,
or

rational explanations, or demonstrations of the powers of science; they

want an immediate

appeal to their emotions. Give them that and

they will

do the rest—such as imagine they can be healed by the light reflected from
a rock a

quarter million miles away. Dr. Weisleder had no need of pills, or

of lengthy lectures on the moon’s power, or of any silly gadgetry to amplify
its rays. He understood that the simpler the spectacle the better—just the

moonlight pouring in from the side, the stairway leading to the heavens,
and the rays of the moon, whether directly visible or not. Any added effects might have made it seem that the moon was not strong enough on its
own. And the moon was strong enough——it was a magnet for fantasies, as it
has been throughout history. Simply by associating himself with the image
of the moon, the doctor gained power.
Remember: Your search for power depends on shortcuts. You must always circumvent people’s suspicions, their perverse desire to resist your
will. Images are an extremely effective shortcut: Bypassing the head, the
seat of doubt and resistance, they aim straight for the heart. Overwhelming
the eyes, they create powerful associations, bringing people together and
stirring their emotions. With the white light of the moon in their eyes, your
targets are blinded to the deceptions you practice.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In 1536 the future king Henri II of France took his first mistress, Diane de
Poitiers. Diane was t.hirty—seven at the time, and was the widow of the

grand seneschal of Normandy. Henri, meanwhile, was a sprightly lad of
seventeen, who was just beginning to sow his wild oats. At first their union
seemed merely platonic, with Henri showing an intensely spiritual devotion to Diane. But it soon became clear that he loved her in every way, pre-

ferring her bed to that of his young wife, Catherine de’ Médicis.
In 1547 King Francis died and Henri ascended to the throne. This new
situation posed perils for Diane de Poitiers. She had just turned forty-eight,
and despite her notorious cold baths and rumored youth potions, she was
beginning to show her age; now that Henri was king, perhaps he would return to the queen's bed, and do as other kings had done—choose mistresses from the bevy of beauties who made the French court the envy of
Europe. He was, after all, only twenty-eight, and cut a dashing figure. But
Diane did not give up so easily. She would continue to enthrall her lover,
as she had enthralled him for the

past eleven years.
Diane’s secret weapons were symbols and images, to which she had al-

ways paid great attention. Early on in her relationship with Henri, she had

created a motif by intertwining her initials with his, to symbolize their
union. The idea worked like a charm: Henri put this insignia everywhereon

Louvre, then the royal palace in Paris. Dia.ne’s favorite colors were black
and white, which she wore exclusively, and wherever it was possible the in-

signia appeared in these colors. Everyone recognized the symbol and its
meaning. Soon after Henri took the throne, however, Diane went still fur»
ther: She decided to identify herself with the Roman goddess Diana, her
namesake. Diana was the goddess of the hunt, the traditional royal pastime
and the particular passion of Henri. Equally important, in Renaissance an

she symbolized chastity and purity. For a woman like Diane to identify herself with this goddess would instantly call up those images in the court, giv-

ing her an air of respectability. Symbolizing her “chaste” relationship with
Henri, it would also set her apart from the adulterous liaisons of royal mistresses past.

To efiect this association, Diane began by completely transforming her

castle at Anet. She razed the building’s structure and in its place erected a

magnificent Doric-columned edifice modeled after a Roman temple. It was
made in white Normandy stone flecked with black silex, reproducing
Diane’s trademark colors of black and white. The insignia of her and
Henn"s initials appeared on the columns, the doors, the windows, the can
pet. Meanwhile, symbols of Diana—crescent moons, stags, and houndsadomed the gates and facade. Inside, enormous tapestries depicting

episodes in the life of the goddess lay on the floors and hung on the walls.
In the garden stood the famous Goujon sculpture Diane Chasseresxe, which is
the Louvre, and which had an uncanny resemblance to Diane de
Poitiers. Paintings and other depictions of Diana appeared in every comer

now in

of the castle.
Anet overwhelmed Henri, who soon was trumpeting the image of
Diane de Poitiers as a Roman goddess. In 1548, when the couple appeared

together in Lyons for a royal celebration, the townspeople welcomed them
with a tableau vimznt depicting a scene with Diana the huntress. France’s
greatest poet of the period, Pierre de Ronsard, began to write verses in
honor of Diana—indeed a kind of cult of Diana sprang up, all inspired by
the king’s mistress. It seemed to Henri that Diane had given herself a kind
of divine aura, and as if he were destined to worship her for the rest of his
life. And until his death, in 1559, he did remain faithful to her—making her
a duchess,
giving her untold wealth, and displaying an almost religious do
votion to his first and only mistress.
Interpretation
Diane de Poitiers, a woman from a modest bourgeois background, man-

aged to captivate Henri for over twenty years. By the time he died she was
well into her sixties, yet his passion for her only increased with the years.
She knew the king well. He was not an intellectual but a lover of the outdoors——he particularly loved jousting tournaments, with their bright pen-

nants, brilliantly caparisoned horses, and beautifully dressed women.
Henri’s love of visual splendor seemed childlike to Diane, and she played
on this weakness of his at

312

LAW 37

every opportunity.

~

Most astute of all was Diane’s appropriation of the goddess Diana.
Here she took the game beyond physical imagery into the realm of the psychic symbol. It was quite a feat to transform a king’s mistress into an emblem of power and purity, but she managed it. Vfithout the resonance of
the goddess, Diane was merely anraging courtesan. With the imagery and

symbolism of Diana on her shoulders, she seemed a mythic force, destined
for greatness.

ciations unintended by the speaker.

The visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of words. It
strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no gaps for reflecfion and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational, reasonable

droughts. Imagine the Moon Doctor trying to make a case for his medical
practice, trying to convince the unconverted by telling them about the
healing powers of the moon, and about his own special connection to a distant object in the sky. Fortunately for him, he was able to create a compelling spectacle that made words unnecessary. The moment his patients
entered the beer hall, the image of the moon spoke eloquently enough.
Understand: Words put you on the defensive. If you have to explain
yourself your power is already in question. The image, on the other hand,
imposes itself as a given. It discourages questions, creates forceful associations, resists unintended interpretations, communicates instantly, and
forges bonds that transcend social dilferences. Words stir up arguments
and divisions; images bring people together. They are the quintessential instruments of power.

The

symbol has the same force, whether it is visual (the statue of
LAW 3 7

313

Diana) or a verbal description of something visual (the words “the Sun
King”). The symbolic object stands for something else, something abstract
(such as the image “Diana” standing for chastity). The abstract conceptpurity, patriotism, courage, lovc~—~is full of emotional and powerful associations. The symbol is a shortcut of expression, containing dozens of
meanings in one simple phrase or object. The symbol of the Sun King, as
explained by Louis XIV, can be read on many layers, but the beauty of it is
that its associations required no explanation, spoke immediately to his subjects, distinguished him from all other kings, and conjured up a kind of
majesty that went far beyond the words themselves. The symbol contains
untold power.
The first step in using symbols and images is to understand the primacy of sight among the senses. Before the Renaissance, it has been an
gued, sight and the other senses--taste, touch, and so on-—-operated on a

relatively equal plane. Since then, however, the visual has come to dominate the others, and is the sense we most

depend on and trust. As Gracién

said, “The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.” When the Renaissance
painter Fra Filippo Lippi was a captured slave among the Moors, he won
his freedom by sketching a drawing of his master on a white wall with a

piece of charcoal; when the owner saw the drawing, he instantly understood the power of a man who could make such images, and let Fra Lippi
go. That one image was far more powerful than any argument the artist
could have made with words.
Never neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like color,
for example, have enormous symbolic resonance. When the con artist Yellow Kid Weil created a newsletter touting the phony stocks he was ped-

dling, he called it the “Red Letter Newsletter” and had it printed, at
considerable expense, in red ink. The color created a sense of urgency,

power, and good fortune. Weil recognized details like these as keys to deception—as do modern advertisers and mass-marketers. If you use “gold”
in the title of anything you are trying to sell, for example, print it in gold.
.

Since the eye predominates, people will respond more to the color than to
the word.
The wsual contains great emotional power. The Roman emperor Constantine worshipped the sun as a god for most of his life; one day, though,

he looked up at the sun, and saw a cross superimposed on it. The vision of
the cross over the sun proved to him the ascendancy of the new religion,
and he converted not just himself but the whole Roman Empire to Chris-

tianity soon thereafter. All the preaching and proselytizing in the world

Most effective of all is anew con1bination—a fusion of images and symbols that have not been seen together before, but that through their association clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion. The creation of

Visual images often appear in a sequence, and the order in which they
appear creates a symbol. The first to appear, for instance, symbolizes
power; the image at the center seems to have central importance‘
Near the end of World War II, orders came down from General Eisenhower thax American troops were to lead the way into Paris after its liber~
ation from the Nazis. The French general Charles de Gaulle, however,

realized that this sequence would imply that the Americans now commanded the fate of France. Through much manipulation, de Gaulle made
certain that he and the French Second Armored Division would appear at

the head of the liberating force. The strategy worked: After he had success

fully pulled off this stunt, the Allies started treating him as the new leader
of an independent France. De Gaulle knew that a leader has to locate him’
self literally at the head of his troops. This visual association is crucial to the

emotional response that he needs to elicit.

Things change in the game of symbols: It is probably no longer possiv
ble to pose as a “sun king,” or to wrap the mantle of Diana around you. Yet
you can associate yourself with such symbols more indirectly. And, of
course, you can make your own mythology out of figures from more re-

people who are comfortably dead but still powerfully associaw
five in the public eye. The idea is to give yourself an aura, a stature that
your normal banal appearance simply will not create. By herself Diane de
Poitiers had no such radiant powers; she was as human and ordinary as
cent history,

most of us. But the

symbol elevated her above the human lot, and made

her seem divine.

Using symbols also has a courtierlike effect, since they are often gentler than brutish words. The psychotherapist Dr. Milton H. Erickson always tried to find symbols and images that would communicate to the
patient in ways that words could not. When dealing with a severely trou~
bled patient, he would not question him directly but would talk about

something irrelevant, such as driving through the desert in Arizona, where
he practiced in the 19505. In describing this he would eventually come to
an appropriate
symbol for what he suspected was the man’s problem. If he
felt the palient was isolated, say, Dr. Erickson would talk of a single ironwood tree, and how its isolation left it battered by the winds. Making an
emotional connection with the tree as a symbol, the patient would open up
more readily to the doctor’: probing.
Use the power of symbols as a way to rally, animate, and unite your
troops or team. During the rebellion against the French crown in 1648,
those loyal to the king disparaged the rebels by comparing them to the
slingshots (in French, fiandesl that little boys use to frighten big boys. Cardi~
nal de Retz decided to turn this disparaging term into the rebels’ symbol:
The uprising was now known as the Fronde, and the rebels as fivndeurs.
They began to wear sashes in their hats that symbolized the slingshot, and
the word became their rallying cry. Without it the rebellion might well

Around the year 478 B.C., the city of Sparta sent an expedition to Persia led

by the young Spartan nobleman Pausanias. The city—states of Greece had
recently fought off a mighty invasion from Persia, and now Pausanias,
along with allied ships from Athens, had orders to punish the invaders and
win back the islands and coastal towns that the Persians had occupied.
Both the Athenians and the Spartans had great respect for Pausanias-—he
had proven himself as a fearless warrior, with a flair for the dramatic.
With amazing speed, Pausanias and his troops took

Cyprus, then

moved on to the mainland of Asia Minor known as the Hellespont and

captured Byzantium {modem-day Istanbul). Now master of part of the Persian empire, Pausanias began to show signs of behavior that went beyond

his normal flarnboyance. He appeared in public wearing pomades in his
hair and flowing Persian robes, and accompanied by a bodyguard of Egyptians. He held lavish banquets in which he sat in the Persian manner and

demanded to be entertained. He stopped seeing his old friends, entered
into communication with the Persian King Xerxes, and all in all affected

the style and manner of a Persian dictator.

Clearly power and success had gone to Pausanias’s head. His armyAthenians and Spartans alike—at first thought this a passing fancy: He had
always been a bit exaggerated in his gestures. But when he ilaunted his disdain for the Greeks’ simple way of life, and insulted the common Greek
soldier, they began to feel he had gone too far. Although there was no con’
crete evidence for this, rumors spread that he had gone over to the other
side, and that he dreamed of becoming a kind of Greek Xerxes. To quell
the possibility of mutiny, the Spartans relieved Pausanias of his command
and called him home.

Pausanias, however, continued to dress in the Persian style, even in
Sparta. After a few months be independently hired a trireme and returned
to the Hellespont, telling his compatriots he was going to continue the Fight
against the Persians. Actually, however, he had different plans———to make
himself ruler of all Greece, with the aid of Xerxes himself. The Spartans
declared him a public enemy and sent a ship to Capture him. Pausanias surrendered, certainlthat he could clear himself of the charges of treason. It
did come out during the trial that during his reign as commander he had
offended his fellow Greeks time and again, erecting monuments, for in-

fought alongside him, as was the custom. Yet Pausanias proved right: De~
spite the evidence of his numerous contacts with the enemy, the Spartans
refused to imprison a man of such noble birth, and let him go.
Now thinking himself untouchable, Pausanias hired a messenger to

BALTAX/xR (‘rR.-xi‘!/x.~.
l(>(ll W058

take a letter to Xerxes, but the messenger instead took the letter to the

Spartan authorities. These men wanted to find out more, so they had the
messenger arrange to meet Pausanias in a temple where they could hide
and listen behind a partition. l/Vhat Pausanias said shocked them»-they
had never heard such contempt for their ways spoken so brazenly by one
of their 0wn—-—and they made arrangements for his immediate arrest.
318

LAW 38

On his way home from the temple, Pausanias got word of what had

happened. He ran to another temple to hide, but the authorities followed
him there and placed sentries all around. Pausanias refused to surrender.

Unwilling to forcibly remove him from the sacred temple, the authorities
kept him trapped inside, until he eventually died of starvation.

Ovm,
c. 43 B.(7.—/\.D.

Interpretation
At first glance it might seem that Pausanias simply fell in love with another
culture, a phenomenon as old as time. Never comfortable with the asceticism of the Spartans, he found himself enthralled by the Persian love of
luxury and sensual pleasure. He put on Persian robes and perfumes with a
sense of deliverance from Greek discipline and
simplicity.
This is how it appears when people adopt a culture in which they were
not raised. Often, however, there is also something else at play: People
who flaunt their infatuation with a different culture are expressing a dis
dain and contempt for their own. They are using the outward appearance

of the exotic to separate themselves from the common folk who unques-

tioningly follow the local customs and laws, and to express their sense of
superiority. Otherwise they would act with more dignity, showing respect

for those who do not share their desires. Indeed their need to show their
difference so dramatically often makes them disliked by the people whose
beliefs

they challenge, indirectly and subtly, perhaps, but’ offensively

nonetheless.
As Thucydides wrote of Pausanias, “By his contempt for the laws and

his imitation of foreign ways he had made himself very widely suspected of

being unwilling to abide by normal standards.” Cultures have norms that
reflect centuries of shared beliefs and ideals. Do not expect to scoff at such

things with impunity. You will be punished somehow, even if just through
isolation—a position of real powerlessness.
Many of us, like Pausanias, feel the siren call of the exotic, the foreign‘
Measure and moderate this desire. Flaunting your pleasure in alien ways of
thinking and acting will reveal a different motive————to demonstrate your superiority over your fellows.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAVV

During the late sixteenth century, a violent reaction against the Protestant
Reformation erupted in Italy. The Counter-Reformation, as it was called,
included its own version of the Inquisition to root out all deviations from
the Catholic Church. Among its victims was the scientist Galileo, but an
important thinker who suffered even greater persecution was the Dominican monk and

philosopher Tommaso Campanella.

A follower of the materialist doctrine of the Roman philosopher Epicums, Campanella did not believe in miracles, or in heaven and hell. The

Church had promoted such superstitions, he wrote, to control the common
folk by keeping them in fear. Such ideas verged on atheism, and Cam-

panella. expressed them incautiously. In 1593 the Inquisition threw him

Campanella became involved in a plot to fight and throw out these in»
vaders. His hope was to establish an independent republic based on his
own ideas of
utopia. The leaders of the Italian Inquisition, working with
their Spanish counterparts, had him imprisoned again. This time they also
tortured him, to discover the true nature of his impious beliefs: He was subjected to the infamous la zzeglia, a torture in which he was suspended by his
arms in a
squatting position a few inches above a seat studded with spikes.
The posture was impossible to sustain, and in time the victim would end up
sitting on the spikes, which would tear his flesh at the slightest contact.
During these years, however, Campanella learned something about
power. Facing the prospect of execution for heresy, he changed his s|:a.t~
egy: He would not renounce his beliefs, yet he knew he had to disguise
their outward appearance.
To save his life, Campanella feigned madness. He let his inquisifors

imagine thax his beliefs stemmed from an inconuollable unsoundness of
mind. For a while the tortures continued, to see if his insanity was faked,
but in 1603 his sentence was commuted to life in prison. The first four
years of this he spent chained to a wall in an underground dungeon. De»
spite such conditions, he continued to write--although no longer would he
be so foolish as to express his ideas directly.
One book of Ca.mpa.uella’s, 771:: Hispanic Monardzy, promoted the idea
that Spain had a divine. mission to expand its powers around the world,

and offered the Spanish king practical, Machiavelli-type advice for achiev-

ing this. Despite his own interest in Machiavelli, the book in general pre
sented ideas completely the opposite to his own. The Hispanirr Monarchy was
in fact a ploy, an attempt to show his conversion to orthodoxy in the bold-

possible. It worked: In 1626, six years after its publication, the
pope finally let Campanella out of prison.
Shortly afier gaining his freedom, Campanella wrote Atheism Con»
guered, a book attacking ‘free-thinkers, Machiavellians, Calvinists, and

heretics of all stripes. The book is written in the form of debates in which

The arguments in the mouths of the heretics had never before been

expressed with such verve and freshness. Pretending to present their side
only to knock it down, Campanella actually summarized the case against
Caxholicism with striking passion. “Then he argued the other side, supposedly his side, on the other hand, he resorted to stale clichés and convoluted
rationales. Brief and eloquent, the heretics’ arguments seemed bold and
sincere. The lengthy arguments for Catholicism seemed tiresome and 1m»

Interpretation
In the face of awesome persecution, Campanella devised three strate-

gic moves that saved his hide, freed him from prison, and allowed him to
continue to express his beliefs. First he feigned ma.dness—«the medieval
equivalent of disavowing responsibility for one’s actions, like blaming
one’s parents today. Next he wrote a book that expressed the exact opposite of his own beliefs. Finally, and most brilliantly of all, he disguised his
ideas while insinuating them at the same time. It is an old but powerful
trick: You pretend to disagree with dangerous ideas, but in the course of
your disagreement you give those ideas expression and exposure. You
seem to conform to the prevailing orthodoxy, but those who know will understand the irony involved. You are protected.
It is inevitable in society that certain values and customs lose contact

with their original motives and become oppressive. And there will always
be those who rebel against such oppression. harboring ideas far ahead of
their time. As Campanella was forced to realize, however, there is no point
in making a display of your dangerous ideas if they only bring you sullen

ing and persecution. Martyrdom serves no purpose~——better to live on in an
oppressive world, even to thrive in it Meanwhile find a way to express
your ideas subtly for those who understand you. Laying your pearls before
swine will only bring you trouble.

KEYS TO POWER
We all tell lies and hide our true feelings, for complete free expression is a
social impossibility. From an early age we learn to conceal our thoughts,
telling the prickly and insecure what we know they want to hear, watching
carefully lest we otfend them. For most of us this is natural—there are ideas
and values that most people accept, and it is pointless to argue. We believe
what we want to, then, but on the outside we wear a mask.
There are people, however, who see such restraints as an intolerable

infringement on their freedom, and who have a need to prove the superiLAW 38

ority of their values and beliefs. In the end, though, their arguments convince only a few and offend a great deal more. The reason arguments do
not work is that most people hold their ideas and values without

ally do not want to have to rework their habits of thinking, and when you
challenge them, whether directly through your arguments or indirectly
through your behavior, they are hostile.
Wise and clever people learn early on that they can display conventional behavior and mouth conventional ideas without having to believe in
them. The power these people gain from blending in is that of being left
alone to have the thoughts they want to have, and to express them to the
people they want to express them to, without suliering isolation or as
tracism. Once they have established themselves in a position of power,
they can try to convince a wider circle of the correctness of their ideasperhaps working indirectly, using Campanella’s strategies of irony and insinuation.

thinking

about them. There is a strong emotional content in their beliefs: They re-

tion of the Jews, murdering thousands and driving others out of the coun»

try. Those who remained in Spain were forced to convert. Yet over the next
three hundred years, the Spanish noticed a phenomenon that disturbed

them: Many of the converts lived their outward lives as Catholics, yet

somehow managed to retain their Jewish beliefs, practicing the religion in
private. Many of these so-called Marranos (originally a derogatory term,
being the Spanish for “pig”) attained high levels of government office, married into the nobility, and gave every appearance of Christian piety, only
to be discovered late in life as
practicing Jews. (The Spanish Inquisition

specifically commissioned to ferret them out.) Over the years they
mastered the art of dissimulation, displaying cmcifixes liberally, giving
was

generous gifts to churches, even occasionally making anti-Semitic
rema.rks—~and all the while maintaining their inner freedom and beliefs.
In society, the Man-anos knew, outward appearances are what matter.
This remains true today. The strategy is simple: As Campanella did in writ-

ing Atheism Conquered, make a show of blending in, even going so far as to
be the most zealous advocate of the prevailing orthodoxy. If you stick to
conventional appearances in public few will believe you think differently
in private.

Do not be so foolish as to imagine that in our own time the old ortho—
doxies are gone. Jonas Salk, for instance, thought science had gotten past

politics and protocol. And so, in his search for a polio vaccine, he broke all
the rules--going public with a discovery before showing it to the scientific
community, taking credit for the vaccine without acknowledging the scientists who had paved the way, making himself a star. The public may have
loved him but scientists shunned him. His disrespect for his community’s
orthodoxies left him isolated, and he wasted years trying to heal the
breach, and struggling for funding and cooperation.
Bertolt Brecht underwent a modern form of Inquisition—tl1e House

LAW 38

Un—American Activities Committee-and approached it with considerable
canniness. Having worked off and on in the American film industry during

World War II, in 1947 Brecht was summoned to appear before the committee to answer quesfions on his suspected Communist sympathies.

Other

writers called before the committee made a point of attacking its members,

and of acting as belligerently as possible in order to gain sympathy for
themselves. Brecht, on the other hand, who had actually worked stead»

lastly for the Communist cause, played the opposite game: He answered
questions with ambiguous generalities that defied easy interpretation. Call
it the Carnpanella strategy. Brecht even were a suit————a rare event for him—and made a point of smoking a cigar during the proceedings, knowing that
akey committee member had a passion for cigars. In the end he charmed
the committee members, who let him go scobfree.

Brecht then moved to East Germany, where he encountered a different kind of Inquisition. Here the Communists were in power, and they crit»

icized his plays as decadent and pessimistic. He did not argue with them,
but made small changes in the performance scripts to shut them up. Mean«
while he managed to preserve the published texts as written. His outward

conformity in both cases gave him the freedom to work unhindered, with
out having to change his thinking. In the end, he made his way safely
through dangerous times in different countries through the use of little
dances of orthodoxy, and proved he was more powerful than the forces of
repression.
Not only do people of power avoid the offenses of Pausanias and Salk,
they also learn to play the clever fox and feign the common touch. This has
been the ploy of con artists and politicians throughout the centuries. Lead-

Julius Caesar and Franklin D. Roosevelt have overcome their nab
ural aristocratic stance to cultivate a familiarity with the common man.
They have expressed this familiarity in little gestures, often symbolic, to
show the people that their leaders share popular values, despite their differers like

ent status.

The logical extension of this practice is the invaluable ability to be all
things to all people. When you go into society, leave behind your own
ideas and values, and put on the mask that is most appropriate for the
group in which you find yourself. Bismarck played this game successfully
for yearsmthere were people who vaguely understood what he was up to,
but not clearly enough that it mattered. People will swallow the bait beit flatters them to believe that you share their ideas. They will not
take you as a hypocrite if you are careful~——for how can they accuse you of
cause

hypocrisy if you do not let them know exactly what you stand for? Nor will
they see you as lacking in values. Of course you have values~——the values
you share with them, while in their company.

your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under

The only time it is worth standing out is when you already stand outwhen you have achieved an unshakable position of power, and can display
your difference from others as a sign of the distance between you. As pres—
ident of the United States, Lyndon Johnson would sometimes hold meet-

ings while he sat on the toilet. Since no one else either could or would
claim such a “privilege,” Johnson was showing people that he did not have
to observe the protocols and nicefies of others. The Roman emperor

Caligula played the same game: He would wear a woman’s negligee, or a
bathrobe, to receive important visitors. He even went so far as to have his
horse elected consul. But it backfired, for the people hated Caligula, and
his gestures eventually brought his overthrow. The truth is that even those
who attain the heights of power would be better off at least affecting the

Fouché, the minister of police. Immediately on arriving in the capital the

his own ministers undermining him.
As Napoleon talked, Talleyrand leaned on the mantelpiece, looking
completely indifferent. Facing Talleyrand directly, Napoleon announced,
“For these ministers, treason has begun when they permit themselves to
doubt.” At the word “treason” the ruler expected his minister to be afraid.
But Talleyrand only smiled, calm and bored.
The sight of a subordinate apparently serene in the face of charges that
could get him hanged pushed Napoleon to the edge. There were ministers,
he said, who wanted him dead, and he took a step closer to Talleyrand—
who stared back at him unfazed. Finally Napoleon exploded. “You are a
coward,” he screamed in Talleyrand’s face, “a man of no faith. Nothing is
sacred to you. You would sell your own father. I have showered you with
riches and yet there is nothing you would not do to hurt me.” The other
ministers looked at each other in disbelief—they had never seen this fear-

less general, the conqueror of most of Europe, so unhinged.
“You deserve to be broken like glass,” Napoleon continued, stamping.

"

“Ah, lam glad you
have told the that,

into the meeting right after their arrival, he began pacing up and down,

“I have the power to do it, but I have too much contempt for you to bother.

Why didn’t I have you hanged from the gates of the Tuileries? But there is
still time for that.” Yelling, almost out of breath, his face red, his eyes
bulging, he went on, “You, by the way, are nothing but shit in a silk stockWhat about your wife? You never told me that San Carlos was your
wife’s lover?” “Indeed, sire, it did not occur to me that this information had

any bearing on Your Majesty’s glory or my own,” said Talleyrand calmly,
completely unflustered. After a few more insults, Napoleon walked away.

Talleyrand slowly crossed the room, moving with his characteristic limp.
As an attendant helped him with his cloak, he turned to his fellow ministers
(all afraid they would never see him again), and said, “What a pity, gentle
men, that so great a man should have such bad manners.”

Despite his anger, Napoleon Hid not arrest his foreign minister. He
merely relieved him of his duties d banished him from the court, believing that for this man humiliation would be punishment enough. He did not
realize that word had quickly spread of his tirade—of how the emperor had
completely lost control of himself, and how Talleyrand had essentially humiliated him by maintaining his composure and dignity. A page had been
turned: For the first time people had seen the great emperor lose his cool
under fire. A feeling spread that he was on the way down. As Talleyrand
later said, “This is the beginning of the end.”

fall evenly ground to

signs of his decline, especially in the irrational war with Spain. Sometime in
1808, the minister decided that for the future peace of Europe, Napoleon
had to go. And so he conspired with Fouché.
It is possible that the conspiracy was never anything more than a
ploy~—a device to push Napoleon over the edge. For it is hard to believe
that two of the most practical men in history would only go halfway in their
plotting. They may have been only stirring the waters, trying to goad
Napoleon into a misstep. And indeed, what they got was the tarrtmrn that
laid out his loss of control for all to see. In fact, Napoleorfs soon—famous

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW

By the late 1920s, Haile Selassie had nearly achieved his goal of assuming
total control over Ethiopia, a country he felt needed strong and unified
leadership. As regent to the empress Zauditu (stepdaughter of the late
queen) and heir to the throne, Selassie had spent several years weakening
the power of Ethiopia’s various warlords. Now only one real obstacle stood

royal couple hated him and wanted to get rid of him, so to cut short their
plotting he made Gugsa the governor of the northern province of
Begemeder, forcing him to leave the capital, where the empress lived.
For several years Gugsa played the loyal administrator. But Selassie
did not trust him: He knew that Gugsa and the empress were plotting revenge. As time passed and Gugsa made no move, the chances of a plot
only increased. Selassie knew what he had to do: draw Gugsa out, get
under his skin, and push him into action before he was ready.
For several years, a northern tribe, the Azebu Gallas, had been in vir»
tual rebellion against the throne, robbing and pillaging local villages and

refusing to pay taxes. Selassie had done nothing to stop them, letting them
grow stronger. Finally, in 1929, he ordered Ras Gugsa to lead an anny
against these disobedient tfibesmen. Gugsa agreed, but inwardly he
seethed--he had no gmdge against the Azebu Gallas, and the demand that
he fight them hurt his pride. He could not disobey the order, but as he
worked to put together an army, he began to spread an ugly rumor«-that
Selassie was in cahoois with the pope, and planned to convert the country
to Roman Catholicism and make it a colony of Italy. Gugsifs army swelled,
and some of the tribes from which its soldiers came secretly agreed to fight
Selassie. In March of 1930 an enormous force of 35,000 men began to
march, not on the Azebu Gallas but souih, toward the capital of Addis
Ababa. Made confident by his growing strength, Gugsa. now openly led a
holy war to depose Selassie and put the country back in the hands of true
Christians.
He did not see the trap that had been laid for him. Before Selassie had

ordered Gugsa to fight the Azebu Gallas, he had secured the support of the

Ethiopian church. And before the revolt got underway, he had bribed several of Gugsa’s key allies not to show up for battle. As the rebel army
marched south, airplanes flew overhead dropping leaflets announcing that
the highest church officials had recognized Selassie as the tme Christian

leader of Ethiopia, and that they had excommunicated Gugsa for fomenting a civil war. These leaflets severely blunted the emotions behind the
holy crusade. And as battle loomed and the support that Gugsa’s allies had

promised him failed to show up, soldiers began to flee or defect.
When the battle came, the rebel army quicky collapsed. Refusing to
surrender, Ras Gugsa was killed in the fighting. The empress, distraught
over her l1usba.nd’s death, died a few
days later. On April 80, Selassie issued a formal proclamation announcing his new title: Emperor of Ethiopia.
Interpretation
Haile Selassie always saw several moves ahead. He knew that if he let Ras

Gugsa decide the time and place of the revolt, the danger would be much
greaier than if he forced Gngsa to act on Selassie’s terms. So he goaded him
into rebellion by offending his manly pride, asking him to fight people he
had no quarrel with on behalf of a man he hated. Thinking everything out
32.8

LAW 39

ahead, Selassie made sure that Gugsa’s rebellion would come to nothing,
and that he could use it to do away with his last two enemies.
This is the essence of the Law: When the waters are still, your oppo~

KEYS TO POWER

Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their response seems
out of proportion to what occasioned it. They have taken things too seriously, exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been done to them. They are
so sensitive to slight that it becomes comical how much they take person~
ally. More comical still is their belief that their outbursts signify power: The
truth is the opposite: Fetulance is not power, it is a sign of helplessness.
People may temporarily be cowed by your tantrums, but in the end they
lose respect for you. They also realize they can easily undermine a person

The answer, however, is not to repress our angry or emotional re

sponses. For repression drains us of energy and pushes us into strange behavior. lnstead we have to change our perspective: We have to realize that

nothing in the social realm, and in the game of power, is personal.
Everyone is caught up in a chain of events that long predates the present moment. Our anger often stems from problems in our childhood,
from the problems of our parents which stem from their own childhood, on
and on. Our anger also has roots in the many interactions with others, the
accumulated disappointments and heartaches that we have suffered. An individual will often appear as the instigator of our anger but it is much more

complicated, goes far beyond what that individual did to us. If a person explodes with anger at you (and it seems out of proportion to what you did to
them), you must remind yourself that it is not exclusively directed at you-—
do not be so vain. The cause is much larger, goes way bad: in time, involves dozens of prior hurts, and is actually not worth the bother to
understand. Instead of seeing it as a personal grudge, look at the emotional
outburst as a disguised power move, an attempt to control or punish you
cloaked in the form of hurt feelings and anger.
This shift of perspective will let you play the game of power with more
clarity and energy. Instead of overreasting, and becoming ensnared in pet)»

ple’s emotions, you will turn their loss of control to your advantage: You
keep your head while they are losing theirs.
During an important battle in the War of the Three Kingdoms, in the
third century A.D., advisers to the commander Ts’ao Ts’ao discovered docu»

showing that certain of his generals had conspired with the enemy,
and urged him to arrest and execute them. Instead he ordered the documents

ments burned and the matter forgotten. At this critical moment in the bat-

tle, to get upset or demand justice would have reverberated against him:
An angry action would have called attention to the generals’ disloyalty,
which would have harmed the troops’ morale. justice could wait-he

would deal with the generals in time. Ts‘ao Ts’ao kept his head and made
the right decision.

Compare this to Napoleon's response to Talleyrand: Instead of taking
the conspiracy personally, the emperor should have played the game like
Ts’ao Ts’ao, carefully weighing the consequences of any action he took.
The more powerful response in the end would have been to ignore Tal~

leyr-and, or to bring the minister gradually back to his side and punish him
later.

Anger only cuts off our options, and the powerful cannot thrive with
yourself not to take matters personally, and to
control your emotional responses, you will have placed yourself in a position of tremendous power: Now you can play with the emotional responses
of other people. Stir the insecure into action by impugning their manhood,
and by dangling the prospect of an easy victory before their faces. Do as
Houdini did when challenged by the less successful escape artist Kleppini:
Reveal an apparent weakness (Houdini let Kleppini steal the combination
for a pair of cuffs) to hire your opponent into action. Then you can beat
out options. Once you train

him with ease. With the arrogant too you can appear weaker than you are,

taunting them into a rash action.
Sun Pin, commander of the armies of Ch’i and loyal disciple of Sunonce
led his troops against the armies of Wei, which outnumbered him
tzu,
two to one.

“Let us light a hundred thousand fires when our army enters

Wei,” suggested Sun Pin, “fifty thousand on the next day, and only thirty
thousand on the third.” On the third day the Wei general exclaimed, “I
knew the men of Ch’i were cowards, and after only three days more than
half of them have deserted!” So, leaving behind his slow-moving heavy in

fantry, the general decided to seize the moment and move swiftly on the
Ch’i camp with a lightly armed force. Sun Pin’s troops retreated, luring
Wei’s army into a narrow pass, where they ambushed and destroyed them.
With the Wei general dead and his forces decimated, Sun Pin now easily
defeated the rest of his army.
In the face of a hot—headed enemy, finally, an excellent response is no
response. Follow the Talleyrand tactic: Nothing is as infuriating as a man
who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs. If it will work to your ad-

vantage to unsettle people, affect the aristocratic, bored pose, neither
mocking nor triumphant but simply indifferent. This will light their fuse.

REVERSAL

When playing with people’s emotions you have to be careful. Study the
enemy beforehand: Some fish are best left at the bottom of the pond.
The leaders of the city of Tyre, capital of ancient Phoenicia, felt confldent they could withstand Alexander the Great, who had conquered the
Oiient but had not attacked their city, which stood well protected on the
water.

They sent ambassadors to Alexander saying that although they

would recognize him as emperor they would not allow him or his forces to
enter Tyre. This of course enraged him, and he

immediately mounted a

siege. For four months the city withstood him, and finally he decided that
the struggle was not worth it, and that he would come to terms with the

Tyrians. But they, feeling that they had already baited Alexander and gotten away with it, and confident that they could withstand him, refused to

331

negotiate«—-in. fact they killed his messengers,
This pushed Alexander over the edge. Now it did not matter to him
how long the siege lasted or how large an army it needed; he had the resources, and would do whatever it took He remounted his assault so siren-

uously that he captured Tyre within days, burned it to the ground, and sold
its people into slavery.
You can bait the powerful and get them to commit and divide their
forces as Sun Pin did, but test the waters first. Find the gap in their strength.
If there is no gap--if they are impossibly strong——you have nothing to gain
and everything to lose by provoking them. Choose carefully whom you
bait, and never stir up the sharks.

Finally there are times when a we1l—timed burst of anger can do you
good, but your anger must be manufactured and under your control. Then
you can determine exactly how and on whom it will fall. Never stir up re
actions that will work against you in the long run. And use your thunder
bolts rarely, to make them the more intimidating and meaningful. Whether
purposefully staged or not, if your outbursts come too often, they will lose
their power.

In the realm of power, everything must be judged by its cost, and every-

thing has a price. What is offered for free or at bargain rates often comes
with a. psychological pn’ce tag—-complicated feelings of obligation, compromises with quality, the insecurity those compromises bring, on and on.
The powerful learn early to protect their most valuable resources: independence and room to maneuver. By paying the full price, they keep themselves free of dangerous entanglements and worries.
Being open and flexible with money also teaches the value of strategic
generosity, a variation on the old trick of “giving when you are about to
take.” By giving the appropriate gift, you put the recipient under obligation. Generosity softens people up——to be deceived. By gaining a reputation for liberality, you win people’: admiration while distracting them from
your power plays. By strategically spreading your wealth, you charm the
other courtiers, creating pleasure and making valuable allies.
Look at the masters of power——the Caesars, the Queen Elizabeths, the
Michelangelos, the Mecljcis: Not a miser among them. Even the great con
artists spend freely to swindle. Tight purse strings are unattractive——when
engaged in seduction, Casanova would give completely not only of himself
but of his wallet. The powerful understand that money is psychologically
charged, and that it is also a vessel of politeness and sociability. They make
the human side of money a weapon in their armory.
For everyone able to play with money, thousands more are locked in a
self-destructive refusal to use money creatively and strategically. These

types represent the opposite pole to the powerful, and you must learn to
recognize them-——either to avoid their poisonous natures or to turn their in-

flexibility to your advantage:

not just in money but in time, dignity, and peace of mind. And this is ex»

bargains, they worry endlessly about what they could have gotten else

way of asserting their power. They might, for example, make you wait for
money that is owed you, promising you that the check is in the mail. Or if

they hire you to work for them, they meddle in every aspect of the job,
haggling and giving you ulcers. Sadists seem to think that paying for some
thing gives them the right to torture and abuse the seller. They have no
sense of the couriier element in money. If you are unlucky enough to get
involved with this type, accepting a financial loss may be better in the long
run than getting entangled in their destructive power games.

In February of 1541, the largest expedition yet in this venture, led by
Piza.rr0’s brother Gonzalo, left Quito, in Ecuador. Resplendent in their armors and colorful

silks, 340 Spaniards headed east, along with 4,000 Indicarry supplies and serve as scouts, 4,000 swine, dozens of llamas,
and close to 1,000 dogs. But the expedition was soon hit by torrential rain,

way to avoid Gonzalds wrath was to make up stories about El Dorado
and send him as far away as possible. As Gonzalo and his men followed

forcing them to walk barefoot; the Indian slaves they had set out with had
either died or deserted them; they had eaten not only the svsnne but the
hunting dogs and llamas. They lived on roots and fruit. Realizing that they
could not continue this way, Pizarro decided to risk river travel, and a

barge was built out of rotting wood. But the journey down the treacherous
Napo River proved no easier. Setting up camp on the n‘ver’s edge, Gonzalo
sent scouts ahead on the barge to find Indian settlements with food. He
waited and waited for the scouts to return, only to find out they had decided to desert the expedition and continue down the river on their own.
The rain continued without end. Gonzalo’s men forgot about El Dorado; they wanted only to return to Quito. Finally, in August of 1542, a little over a hundred men, from an expedition originally numbering in the
thousands, managed to find their way back. To the residents of Quito they
seemed to have emerged from hell itself, wrapped in tatters and skins, their
bodies covered in sores, and so emaciated as to be unrecognizable. For
over a
year and a half they had marched in an enormous circle, two thousand miles by foot. The vast sums of money invested in the expedition had
yielded nothing-—no sign of El Dorado and no sign of gold.

In the early eighteenth century, no one stood higher in English society
than the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. The duke, having led sue»
cessful campaigns against the French, was considered Europe’s premier
general and strategist. And his wife, the duchess, after much maneuvering,
had established herself as the favorite of Queen Anne, who became ruler
of England in 1702. In 1704 the duke’s triumph at the Battle of Blenheim
made him the toast of England, and to honor him the queen awarded him
a
large plot of land in the town of Woodstock, and the funds to create a
great palace there. Calling his planned home the Palace of Blenheim, the
duke chose as his architect the young john Vanbrugh, a kind of Renaissance man who wrote
plays as well as designed buildings. And so con—

with much fanfare and great

hopes.
Vanbrugh had a dramatist’s sense of architecture. His palace was to be
a monument to Mar1borough’s brilliance and
power, and was to include
artificial lakes, enormous bridges, elaborate gardens, and other fantastical
touches. From day one, however, the duchess could not be pleased: She
thought Vanbrugh was wasting money on yet another stand of trees; she
wanted the palace finished as soon as possible. The duchess tortured Van~
brugh and his workmen on every detail. She was consumed with petty
matters; although the government was paying for Blenheim, she counted
every penny. Eventually her grumbling, about Blenheim and other things
too, created an irreparable rift between her and Queen Anne, who, in 1711,
dismissed her from the court, ordering her to vacate her apartments at the
royal palace. When the duchess left (fuming over the loss of her position,
and also of her royal salary), she emptied the apartment of every fixture
down to the brass doorknobs.
Over the next ten years, work on Blenheim would stop and start, as
the funds became harder to procure from the government. The duchess

thought Vanbrugh was out to ruin her. She quibbled over every carload of
stone and bushel of lime, counted every extra yard of iron railing or foot of
wainscot, hurling abuse at the wasteful workmen, contractors, and surveyors.
Marlborough, old and weaiy, wanted nothing more than to settle into
the palace in his last years, but the project became bogged down in a
swamp of litigation, the workmen suing the duchess for wages, the duchess
suing the architect right back. In the midst of this interminable wrangling,
the duke died. He had never spent a night in his beloved Blenheim.
After Ma.rlborough’s death, it became clear that he had a vast estate,
worth over £2 million—-more than enough to pay for finishing the palace.
But the duchess would not relent: She held back Vanbrugh’s wages as well
as the workmerfs, and
finally had the architect dismissed. The man who
took his place finished Blenheim in a few years, following Vanbruglfs designs to the letter. Vanbrugh died in 1726, locked out of the palace by the
duchess, unable to set foot in his greatest creation. Foreshadowing the romantic movement, Blenheim had started a whole new trend in architec-

ture, but had given its creator a twenty—year nightmare.

games. She saw the loss of money as a symbolic loss of power. With Vanbrugh her contortions went deeper still: He was a great artist, and she en~

vied his power to create, to attain a fame outside her reach. She may not
have had his gifts, but she did have the money to torture and abuse him
over the

pettiest details—to ruin his life.

This kind of sadism, however, bears an awful price. It made construe»
tion that should have lasted ten years take twenty. It poisoned many a rela-

tionship, alienated the duchess from the court. deeply pained the duke
(who wanted only to live peacefully in Blenheim), created endless lawsuits,
and took years off Vanbruglfs life. Finally, too, posterity had the last word:
Vanbrugh is recognized as a genius while the duchess is forever remem«
bered for her consummate cheapness.
The powerful must have grandeur of spirit»-they can never reveal any
petfiness. And money is the most visible arena in which to display either
grandeur or pettiness. Best spend freely, then, and create a reputation for
generosity, which in the end will pay great dividends. Never let financial
details blind you to the bigger picture of how people perceive you. Their
resentment will cost you in the long run. And if you want to meddle in the
work of creative people under your hire, at least pay them well. Your
money will buy their submission better than your displays of power.

Pietro Aretino, son of a lowly shoemaker, had catapulted himself into fame
as a writer of
biting satires. But like every Renaissance artist, he needed to
find a patron who would give him a comfortable lifestyle while not inter

fering with his work. In 1528 Aretino decided to attempt a new strategy in
the patronage game. Leaving Rome, he established himself in Venice,
where few had heard of him. He had a fair amount of money he had man-

aged to save, but little else. Soon after he moved into his new home, however, he flirew open its doors to rich and poor, regaling them with
banquets and amusements. He befriended each and every gondolier, tipping them royally. In the streets, he spread his money liberally, giving it
away to beggars, orphans, Washerwomen. Among the city’s commoners,
word quickly spread that Aretino was more than just a great writer, he was
power—-a kind of lord.
Artists and men of influence soon began to frequent Areu‘no’s house.

a man of

Within a few years he made himself a celebrity; no visiting dignitary would
think of leaving Venice without paying him a call. His generosity had cost
him most of his savings, but had bought him influence and a good name—
a cornerstone in the foundation of
power. Since in Renaissance Italy as
elsewhere the ability to spend freely was the privilege of the rich, the arisv

tocracy thought Aretino had to be a man of influence, since he spent
money like one. And since the influence of a man of influence is worth
buying, Aretino became the recipient of all sorts of gifts and moneys.
Dukes and duchesses, wealthy merchants, and popes and princes competed to gain his favor, and showered him with all kinds of presents.
Aretino’s spending habits, of course, were strategic, and the strategy

worked like a charm. But for real money and comfort he needed a great

patron’s bottomless pockets. Having surveyed the possibilities, he eventually set his sights on the extremely wealthy Marquis of Mantua, and wrote
an
epic poem that he dedicated to the marquis. This was a common practice of writers looking for patronage: In exchange for a dedication they
would get a small stipend, enough to write yet another poem, so that they
spent their lives in a kind of constant servility. Aretino, however, wanted
power, not a measly wage. He might dedicate a poem to the marquis, but
he would offer it to him as a gift, implying by doing so that he was not a
hired hack looking for a stipend but that he and the marquis were equals.
Aret.ino’s gift-giving did not stop there: As a close friend of two of
Venice’s greatest artists, the sculptor Jacopo Sansovino and the painter
Titian, he convinced these men to participate in his gift-giving scheme.
Aretino had studied the marquis before going to work on him, and knew
his taste inside and out; he was able to advise Sansovirio and Titian what

subject matter would please the marquis most. When he then sent a Sansovino sculpture and a Titian painting to the marquis as gifts from all three of

them, the man was beside himself with joy.
Over the next few months, Aretino sent other gifts——swords, saddles,
the glass that was a Venetian specialty, things he knew the marquis prized.
Soon he, Titian, and Sansovino began to receive gifts from the marquis in
return. And the strategy went further: When the son-in—law of a friend of
Aretino’s found himself in jail in Mantua, Aretino was able to get the marquis to arrange his release. Aretinds friend, a wealthy merchant, was a
man of

with the marquis to use, Aretino had now bought this man’s indebtedness,
too, and he in turn would help Aretino when he could. The circle of influence was
growing wider. Time and again, Aretino was able to cash in on
the immense political power of the marquis, who also helped him in his

many court romances.

Eventually, however, the relationship became strained, as Aretino
that the marquis should have requited his generosity better.
But he would not lower himself to begging or whining: Since the exchange
of gifts between the two men had made them equals, it would not seem
right to bring up money. He simply withdrew from the marquis’s circle and
hunted for other wealthy prey, settling first on the French king Francis,
then the Medicis, the Duke of Urbino, Emperor Charles V, and more. In

the end, having many patrons meant he did not have to bow to any of
them, and his power seemed comparable to that of a great lord.

Interpretation
Aretino understood two fundamental properties of money: First, that it has
to circulate to

bring power. What money should buy is not lifeless objects
but power over people. By keeping money in constant circulation, Aretino

bought an ever—expanding circle of influence that in the end more than
compensated him for his expenses.
Second, Aretino understood the key property of the gift. To give a gift
is to imply that you and the recipient are equals at the very least, or that
you are the recipient’s superior. A gift also involves an indebtedness or
obligation; when friends, for instance, offer you something for free, you
can be sure
they expect something in return, and that to get it they are
making you feel indebted. (The mechanism may or may not be entirely
conscious on their paxt, but this is how it works.)
Aretino avoided such encumbrances on his freedom. Instead of acting
like a menial who expects the powerful to pay his way in life, he turned the

whole dynamic around; instead of being indebted to the powerful, he
made the powerful indebted to him. This was the point of his gift-giving, a
ladder that carried him to the highest social levels. By the end of his life he
had become the most famous writer in Europe.
Understand: Money may determine power relationships, but those relationships need not depend on the amount of money you have; they also
depend on the way you use it Powerful people give freely, buying influence rather them
things. If you accept the inferior position because you
have no fortune yet, you may find yourself in it forever. Play the trick that

Aretino played on Ita.ly’s aristocracy: Imagine yourself an equal. Play the
lord, give freely, open your doors, circulate your money, and create the fa-

cade of power through an alchemy that transforms money into influence.

Interpretation
Strategic generosity is always a great weapon in building a support base,
particularly for the outsider. But the Baron de Rothschild was cleverer still:
He knew it was his money that had created the barrier between him and

overcome this was

would symbolize its power over other tribes. The base of its power was not
money but its ability to spend, and its confidence in a superiority that
would restore to it all that the potlatch had destroyed.
In the end, the baron’s soirées reflected his desire to mingle not just in

France’s business world but in its society. By wasting money on his pet-

latches, he hoped to demonstrate that his power went beyond money into
the more precious realm of culture. Rothschild may have won social acceptance by spending money, but the support base he gained was one that
money alone could not buy. To secure his fortune he had to “waste” it. That
is strategic generosity in a nutshell——the ability to be flexible with your

wealth, putting it to work, not to buy objects, but to win people’s hearts.

Interpretation
Lorenzo undoubtedly loved the arts, but his patronage of artists had a practical function as well, of which he was keenly aware. In Florence at the
time, banking was perhaps the least admired way of making money, and
was
certainly not a respected source of power. The arts were at the other
pole, the pole of qua.si—religious transcendence. By spending on the arts,
Lorenzo diluted people’s opinions of the ugly source of his wealth, disguising himself in nobility. There is no better use of strategic generosity than
that of distracting attention from an unsavory reality and wrapping oneself
in the mantle of art or religion.

begged him to sell him the cup, which must clearly be valuable if Fushimiya
judged it so. Fushimiya laughed heartily: “It’s just an ordinary cup of Bizen
ware,” he explained, “and it is not valuable at all. The reason I was looking
at it was that the steam seemed to hang about it strangely and I wondered if
there wasn’t a leak somewhere.” (Devotees of the Tea Ceremony were interested in any odd or accidental beauty in nature.) Since the artisan still
seemed so excited about it, Fushimiya gave him the cup for free.
The artisan took the cup around, trying to find an expert who would

appraise it at a high price, but since all of them recognized it as an ordinary
teacup he got nowhere. Soon he was neglecting his own business, thinking

only of the cup and the fortune it could bring. Finally he went to Edo to
talk to Fushimiya at his shop. There the dealer, realizing that he had inad~

worth, paid him 100 ryo (gold pieces) for the cup as a kindness. The cup

while also allowing him to feel that his effort had not been wasted. The artisan thanked him and went on his way.
Soon word spread of Fushimiya’s purchase of the teacup. Every dealer
injapan clamored for him to sell it, since a cup he had bought for 100 ryo
must be worth much more. He tried to explain the circumstances in which
he had bought the cup, but the dealers could not be dissuaded. Fushimiya
finally relented and put the cup up for sale.
During the auction, two buyers simultaneously bid 200 ryo for the
teacup, and then began to fight over who had bid first. Their fighting

the great tea master Matsudalra Fumai visited the store, and asked to see
the cup, which by then had become legendazy. Fumai examined it. “As a

The powerful never forget that what is offered for free is inevitably a trick.
Friends who offer favors without asking for payment will later want some

thing far dearer than the money you would have paid them. The bargain
has hidden problems, both material and psychological. Learn to pay, then,
and to pay well.
On the other hand, this Law offers great opportunities for swindling
and deception if you apply it from the other side. Dangling the lure of at

free lunch is the con artisfs stock in trade.
No man was better at this than the most successful con artist of our

age, Joseph Weil, a.k.a. “The Yellow Kid.” The Yellow Kid learned early
that what made his swindles possible was his fellow humans’ greed. “This
desire to get something for nothing,” he once wrote, “has been very costly
to many people who have dealt with me and with other can men.
When people lea.rn——a3 I doubt they will—that they can’t get something
,

.

.

for nothing, crime will diminish and we shall all live in greater harmony.”

Over the years Weil devised many ways to seduce people with the prospect
of easy money. He would hand out “free” real estate——who could resist
such an offer?——and then the suckers would learn they had to pay $25 to

register the sale. Since the land was free, it seemed worth the high fee, and
the Yellow Kid would make thousands of dollars on the phony registration.
In exchange he would give his suckers a phony deed. Other times, he
would tell suckers about a fixed horse race, or a stock that would earn 200

percent in a few weeks. As he spun his stories he would watch the sucker’s
eyes open wide at the thought of a free lunch.
The lesson is simple: Bait your deceptions with the possibility of easy
money. People are essentially lazy, and want wealth to fall in their lap
rather than to work for it. For at small sum, sell them advice on how to

make millions (P. T. Barnum did this later in life), and that small sum will
become a fortune when multiplied by thousands of suckers. Lure people in
with the prospect of easy money and you have the room to work still more

deceptions on them, since greed is powerful enough to blind your victims
to anything. And as the Yellow Kid said, half the fun is teaching a moral

lesson: Greed does not pay.

LAW 11

When Louis XIV died, in 1715, after a glorious fifty—five-year reign, all eyes
focused on his great-grandson and chosen successor, the future Louis XV.
Would the boy, only five at the time, prove as great a leader as the Sun

King? Louis XIV had transforrned a country on the verge of civil war into
the preeminent power in Europe. The last years of his reign had been difli~
cult—-he had been old and l:ired——but it was hoped that the child would develop into the kind of strong ruler who would reinvigorate the land and
add to the firm foundation that Louis XIV had laid.
To this end the child was given the best minds of France as his tutors,
men

who would instruct him in Lhe ads of statecraft, in the methods that

the Sun King had perfected. Nothing was neglected in his education. But

when Louis XV came to the throne, in 1726, a sudden change came over
him: He no longer had to study or please others or prove himself. He stood
alone at the top of a great country, with wealth and power at his command.
He could do as he wished.
In the first years of his reign, Louis gave himself over to pleasure, leaving the government in the hands of a ousted minister, André-Hercule de

Fleuiy. This caused little concern, for he was a. young man who needed to
sow his wild oats, and de
Fleury was a good minister. But it slowly became
clear that {his was more than a passing phase. Louis had no interest in gov-

erning. His main worry was not France’s finances, or a possible war with
Spain, but boredom. He could not stand being bored, and when he was not
hunting deer, or chasing young girls, he whiled away his time at the gainbling tables, losing huge sums in a single night.
The court, as usual, reflected the tastes of the ruler. Gambling and lavish parties became the obsession. The courtiers had no concern with the future of France-—they poured their energies into charming the king, angling
for titles that would bring them life pensions, and for cabinet positions demanding little work but paying huge salaries. Parasites flocked to the court,
and the state’s debts swelled.
In 1745 Louis fell in love with Madame de Pompadour, a woman of

middle~cla,ss origin who had managed to rise through her charms, her intel-

ligence, and a good marriage. Madame de Pompadour became the ofiicial
royal mistress; she also became France’s arbiter of taste and fashion. But
the Madame had political ambitions as well, and she eventually emerged
as the
countxy’s unofficial piime minister——it was she, not Louis, who
wielded hiring~and-firing power over France’s most important ministers.
As he grew older Louis only needed more diversion. On the grounds
of Versailles he built a brothel, Pare aux Cerfs, which housed some of the

prettiest young girls of France. Underground passages and hidden staircases gave Louis access at all hours. After Madame de

Pompadour died, in
1764, she was succeeded as royal mistress by Madame du Bariy, who soon
came to dominate the court, and who, like de
Pompadour before her,
began to meddle in affairs of state. If a minister did not please her he would
find himself fired. All of Europe was aghast when du Barry, the daughter of
a baker,
managed to arrange the firing of Etienne de Choiseul, the foreign

minister and France’s most able diplomat. He had shown her too little re-

spect. As time went by, swindlers and Charlatans made their nests in Versailles, and enticed Louis’s interest in astrology, the occult, and fraudulent
business deals. The young and pampered teenager who had taken over

France years before had only grown worse with age.
The motto that became attached to Louis’s reign was

‘.'Apré.r moi, It

de’lugz"——“After me the flood,” or, Let France rot after I am gone. And in
deed when Louis did go, in 1774, worn out by debauchery, his country and
his own finances were in horrible disarray. His grandson Louis XVI inherited a realm in desperate need of reform and a strong leader. But Louis
XVI was even weaker than his grandfather, and could only watch as the
country descended into revolution. In 1792 the republic introduced by the
French Revolution declared the end of the monarchy, and gave the king a
new name, “Louis the Last” A few months later he kneeled on the guillotine, his about—to—be—severed head stripped of all the radiance and power
that the Sun King had invested in the crown.
Interpretation
From a country that had descended into civil war in the late 1640s, Louis
XIV forged the mightiest realm in Europe. Great generals would tremble
in his presence. A cook once made a mistake in prepaiing a dish and com-

mitted suicide rather than face the king’ 5 wrath. Louis XIV had many mis—
tresses, but their power ended in the bedroom. He filled his court with the
most brilliant minds of the age. The symbol of his power was Versailles:

Refusing to accept the palace of his forefathers, the Louvre, he built his

palace in what was then the middle of nowhere, symbolizing that this

seem easy for a son or successor to

with the father’s need to fill a void. As Machiavelli states, necessity is what
impels men to take action, and once the necessity is gone, only rot and

decay are left. Having no need to increase his store of power, Louis XV in—
evitably succumbed to inertia. Under him, Versailles, the symbol of the
Sun K.ing’s authority, became a pleasure palace of incomparable banality,
a kind of Las Vegas of the Bourbon monarchy. It came to represent all that
the oppressed peasantry of France hated about their king, and during the
Revolution they looted it with glee.

without having to compete with another star in the sky. Power depends on

OBSERVANCF. OF THE LAW

Alexander the Great had a dominant passion as a young man—~an intense
dislike for his father, King Philip of Macedonia. He hated Philip’s cunning,
cautious style of ruling, his bombastic speeches, his drinking and whoring,

and his love of wrestling and of other wastes of time. Alexander knew he
had to make himself the very opposite of his domineering father: He would
force himself to be bold and reckless, he would control his tongue and be a

Alexander itched to show others how superior he was to his father. A
Thessalian h0rse»dealer once brought a prize horse named Bucephalus to

sell to Philip. None of the king’s grooms could get near the horse—it was
far too savage——a.nd Philip berated the merchant for bringing him such a
useless beast. Watching the whole affair, Alexander scowled and commented, “What a horse they are losing for want of skill and spirit to man‘
age him!” When he had said this several times, Philip had finally had

enough, and challenged him to take on the horse. He called the merchant
back, secretly hoping his son would have a nasty fa.ll and learn a bitter lesson. But Alexander was the one to teach the lesson: Not

would later carry him all the way to India. The courtiers applauded wildly,
but Philip seethed inside, seeing not a son but a rival to his power.
Alexander’s defiance of his father grew bolder. One day the two men
had a heated argument before the entire court, and Philip drew his sword
as if to strike his son;
having drunk too much wine, however, the king
stumbled. Alexander pointed at his father and jeered, “Men of Macedonia,

proceed cautiously, to do as Philip had done
and conquer through cunning. But Alexander would do things his way: He
marched to the furthest reaches of the kingdom, suppressed the rebellious
towns, and reunited the empire with brutal efficiency.
As a young rebel grows older, his struggle against the father often
wanes, and he gradually comes to resemble the very man he had wanted to
defy. But Alexandefs loathing of his father did not end with Phi.lip’s death.

could not possibly untie the knot with his bare hands, took out his sword
and with one slash cut it in half. This symbolic gesture showed the world

that he would not do as others, but would blaze his own path.

Against astounding odds, Alexander conquered the Persians. Most expected him to stop there--it was a great triumph, enough to secure his
fame for eternity. But Alexander had the same relationship to his own
deeds as he had to his father: His conquest of Persia represented the past,
and he wanted never to rest on past triumphs, or to allow the past to outshine the present. He moved on to India, extending his empire beyond all
known limits. Only his disgruntled and weary soldiers prevented him from
going farther.

Interpretation
Alexander represents an extremely uncommon type in history: the son of
a famous and successful man who
manages to surpass the father in glory
and power. The reason this type is uncommon is simple: The father most
often manages to amass his fortune, his kingdom, because he begins with

KEYS TO POWER
In many ancient kingdoms, for example Bengal and Sumatra, after the

king had ruled for several years his subjects would execute him. This was
done partly as a ritual of renewal, but also to prevent him from growing too
powerful—for the king would generally try to establish a permanent order,
at the expense of other families and of his own sons. Instead of protecting

the tribe and leading it in times of war, he would attempt to dominate it.
And so he would be beaten to death, or executed in an elaborate ritual.
Now that he was no longer around for his h0l101‘S to go to his head, he

could be worshipped as a god. Meanwhile the field had been cleared for a
new and youthful order to establish itself.

The ambivalent, hostile attitude towards the king or father figure also
finds expression in legends of heroes who do not know their father. Moses,
the archetypal man of power, was found abandoned among the bulrushes

and never knew his parents; without a. father to compete with him or limit

him, he could attain the heights of power. Hercules had no earthly father——
he was the son of the god Zeus. Later in his life Alexander the Great spread
the story that the god Jupiter Ammon had sired him, not Philip of Macedon. Legends and rituals like these eliminate the human father because he

symbolizes the destructive power of the past.
The past prevents the young hero from creating his own world--he

been cleared of the dead weight of the past. Only after the father figure has

been properly done away with will you have the necessary space to create
and establish a new order. There are several strategies you can adopt to ac-

complish this—-——varia!ions on the execution of the king that disguise the vio~
lence of the impulse by channeling it in socially acceptable forms.
Perhaps the simplest way to escape the shadow of the past is simply to
belittle it, playing on the timeless antagonism between the generations, stir—
ring up the young against the old. For this you need a convenient older figute to pillory. Mao Tse—tung, confronting a culture that

john F. Kennedy
knew the dangers of getting lost in the past; he radically distinguished his
presidency from that of his predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and also
from the preceding decade, the 19505, which Eisenhower personified.
Kennedy, for instance, would not play the dull and fatherly game of golf——
a symbol of retirement and privilege, and Eisenhowefs passion. Instead he
played football on the White House lawn. In every aspect his administration represented vigor and youth, as opposed to the stodgy Eisenhower.
Kennedy had discovered an old truth: The young are easily set against the
old, since they yearn to make their own place in the world and resent the
shadow of their fathers.
The distance you establish from your predecessor often demands

symbolism, a way of advertising itself publicly. Louis XIV, for example, created such symbolism when he rejected the traditional palace of the
French kings and built his own palace of Versailles. King Philip II of Spain
did the same when he created his center of power, the palace of El Escosome

rial, in what was then the middle of nowhere. But Louis carried the game
further: He would not be a king like his father or earlier ancestors, he

would not wear a crown or carry a scepter or sit on a throne, he would establish a new kind of imposing authority with symbols and rituals of its
own. Louis made his ancestors’ rituals into

laughable relics of the past. Follow his example: Never let yourself be seen as following your predecessor’s path. If you do you will never surpass him. You must physically
demonstrate your difference, by establishing a style and symbolism that
sets you apart.

The Roman emperor Augustus, successor to Julius Caesar, understood
this thoroughly. Caesar had been a great general, a theatrical figure whose

spectacles kept the Romans entertained, an international emissary seduced
by the charms of Cleopat:ra~a largerlhanalife figure. So Augustus, despite
his own theatrical tendencies, competed with Caesar not by trying to outdo
him but by differentiating himself from him: He based his power on a return to Roman simplicity, an austerity of both style and substance. Against
the memory of Caesars sweeping presence Augustus posed a quiet and
manly dignity.

areas

in culture that have been left vacant and in which you can become

the first and principal figure to shine.

When Pericles of Athens was about to launch a career as a statesman,
he looked for the one thing that was missing in Athenian politics. Most of
the great politicians of his time had allied themselves with the aristocracy;
indeed Pericles himself had aristocratic tendencies. Yet he decided to throw
in his hat with the city’s democratic elements. The choice had nothing to

do with his personal beliefs, but it launched him on a brilliant career. Out
of necessity he became a man of the people. Instead of compefing in an
arena

filled with great leaders both past and present, he would make a

name for himself where no shadows could obscure his

presence.
When the painter Diego de Velazquez began his career, he knew he

could not compete in refinement and technique with the great Renaissance

painters who had come before him. Instead he chose to work in a style that

by the standards of the time seemed coarse and rough, in a way that had
never been seen before. And in this style he excelled. There were members of the Spanish court who wanted to demonstrate their own break with
the past; the newness of Velé.zquez’s style thrilled them. Most people are
afraid to break so boldly with tradition, but they secretly admire those who
can break up the old forms and reinvigorate the culture. This is why there
is so much power to be gained from entering vacuums and voids.

There is a kind of stubborn stupidity that recurs throughout history,
and is a strong impediment to power: The superstitious belief that if the
person before you succeeded by doing A, B, and C, you can re-create their
success
by doing the same thing. This cookie-cutter approach will seduce
the uncreative, for it is easy, and appeals to their timidity and their laziness.
But circumstances never repeat themselves exactly.
When General Douglas MacArthur assumed command of American
forces in the Philippines during World War II, an assistant handed him a

book containing the various precedents established by the commanders
before him, the methods that had been successful for them. MacArthur
asked the assistant how many copies there were of this book. Six, the assistant answered. “Well,” the general replied, “you get all those six copies to-

gether and burn them—-every one of them. I’ll not be ‘bound by
precedents. Any time a problem comes up, I’ll make the decision at
once—immediately.” Adopt this ruthless strategy toward the past: Bum all
the books, and train yourself to react to circumstances as they happen.
You may believe that you have separated yourself from the predeces

father figure, but as you grow older you must be eternally vigilant
lest you become the father you had rebelled against. As a young man, Mao
sor or

Tse-tung disliked his father and in the struggle against him found his own
identity and a new set of values. But as he aged, his father’s ways crept back
in. Mao’s father had valued manual work over intellect; Mao had scoffed at

this as a young man, but as he grew older he unconsciously returned to his
father’s views and echoed such outdated ideas by forcing a whole genera.»
tion of Chinese intellectuals into manual labor, a nightmarish mistake that

yourself spend years creating yourself only to let your guard down and
allow the ghost of the past—father, habit, history—to sneak back in.
Finally, as noted in the story of Louis XV, plenitude and prosperity

tend to make us lazy and inactive: When our power is secure we have no
need to act. This is a serious danger, especially for those who achieve success and

power at an early age. The playwright Tennessee Williams, for infound
himself skyrocketed from obscurity to fame by the success of
stance,

The Glass Menagerie. “The sort of life which I had had previous to this popuv
lar success,” he later wrote, “was one that required endurance, a life of

clawing and scratching, but it was a good life because it was the sort of life
for which the human organism is created. I was not aware of how much
vital energy had gone into this struggle until the struggle was removed.

This was security at last. I sat down and looked about me and was suddenly
very depressed.” Williams had a nervous breakdown, which may in fact
have been necessary for him: Pushed to the psychological edge, he could
start writing with the old

vitality again, and he produced A Streetcar Named
Dostoyevsky,
similarly, whenever he wrote a successful
Fyodor
novel, would feel that the financial security he had gained made the act of
Desire.

creation unnecessary. He would take his entire savings to the casino and
would not leave until he had gambled away his last penny. Once reduced
to poverty he could write again.

It is not necessary to go to such extremes, but you must be prepared to
return to square one

psychologically rather than growing fat and lazy with

prosperity. Pablo Picasso could deal with success, but only by constantly

changing the style of his painting, often breaking completely with what
had made him successful before. How often our early triumphs turn us
into a kind of caricature of ourselves. Powerful people recognize these

traps; like Alexander the Great, they struggle constantly to re—create themselves. The father must. not be allowed to return; he must be slain at every

step of the way.

The shadow of a great predecessor could be used to advantage if it is chosen as a

trick, a tactic that can be discarded once it has brought you power

Napoleon III used the name and legend of his illustrious grand-uncle
Napoleon Bonaparte to help him become first president and then emperor
of France. Once on the throne, however, he did not stay tied to the past’, he

quickly showed how different his reign would be, and was careful to keep
the public from expecting him to attain the heights that Bonaparte had attained.
The past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that would
be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even Alexander

the Great recognized and was influenced by his father’s skill in organizing
an

army. Making a display of doing things differently from your predecesyou seem childish and in fact out of control, unless your ac-

The great Baroque artist and architect Pietro Bemini was a master at
sniffing out younger potential rivals and keeping them in his shadow. One

day a young stonemason named Francesco Boiromini showed Bernini his
architectural sketches. Recognizing his talent immediately, Bernini instantly hired Borromini as his assistant, which delighted the young man but
was actually
only a tactic to keep him close at hand, so that he could play
psychological games on him and create in him a kind of inferiority com~
plex. And indeed, despite Borromini’s brilliance, Bernini has the greater
fame. His strategy with Boirornini he made a lifelong practice: Fearing that
the great sculptor Alessandro Algardi, for example, would eclipse him in
fame, he arranged it so that Algardi could only find work as his assistant.
And any assistant who rebelled against Bernini and tried to strike out on
his own would find his career ruined.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
Near the end of the sixth century B.C., the city-state of Athens overthrew

the series of petty tyrants who had dominated its politics for decades. It established instead a democracy that was to last over a century, a dernoc»
racy that became the source of its power and its proudest achievement.
But as the democracy evolved, so did a problem the Athenians had never
faced: How to deal with those who did not concern themselves with the

cohesion of a small city surrounded by enemies, who did not work for its

greater glory, but thought of only themselves and their own ambitions and
petty intrigues? The Athenians understood that these people, if left alone,
would sow dissension, divide the city into factions, and stir up anxieties,
all of which could lead to the ruin of their democracy.

helped defeat the Persians at the battle of Marathon. Meanwhile, off the
battlefield, his fairness as a judge had earned him the nickname “The
just.” But as the years went by the Athenians came to dislike him. He
made such a Show of his righteousness, and this, they believed, disguised
his feelings of superiority and scorn for the common folk. His omnipresence in Athenian
politics became obnoxious; the citizens grew tired of
“The just.” They feared that this was just the type of

man——judgmental, haughty—who would eventually stir up fierce divisions among them, In 482 B.C., despite Aristides’ invaluable expertise in
the continuing war with the Persians, they collected the ostraka and had
him banished.
After Aristides’ ostracism, the great general Themistocles emerged as
the city’s premier leader. But his many honors and victories went to his

head, and he too became arrogant and overbearing, constantly reminding
the Athenians of his triumphs in battle, the temples he had built, the dangers he had fended oil. He seemed to be saying that without him the city
would come to ruin. And so, in 472 B.C., Thernistocles’ name was filled in
on the ostra/ca and the

city was rid of his poisonous presence.
The greatest political figure in fifth-century Athens was undoubtedly

Pericles. Although several times threatened with ostranism, he avoided
that fate by maintaining close ties with the people. Perhaps he had learned

excelled above all other Athenians in his intelligence, his musical skills,
and his rhetorical abilities, It was Damon who had trained Pericles in the
arts of ruling. But he, too, suffered ostracism, for his superior airs and his

insulting manner toward the commoners stirred up too much resentment.
Toward the end of the century there lived a man named Hyperbolus.
Most writers of the time describe him as the city’s most worthless citizen:
He did not care what anyone thought of him, and slandered whomever he
disliked. He amused some, but irritated many more. In 417 B.C., Hyperbolus saw an opportunity to stir up auger against the two leading politicians
of the time, Alcibiades and Nicias. He hoped that one of the two would be
ostracized and that he would rise in that man’s place. His

campaign

seemed likely to succeed: The Athenians disliked Alcibiades’ flamboyant
and carefree lifestyle, and were wary of Nicias’ wealth and aloofness.

They seemed certain to ostracize one or the other. But Alcibiades and
Nicias, although they were otherwise enemies, pooled their resources and
managed to turn the ostracism on Hyperbolus instead. His obnoxiousness, they argued, could only be terminated by banishment.
Earlier sufferers of ostracism had been formidable, powerful men.
Hyperbolus, however, was a low buffoon, and with his banishment the
Athenians felt that ostracism had been degraded. And so they ended the
practice that for nearly a hundred years had been one of the keys to keeping the peace within Athens.

Interpretation
The ancient Athenians had social instincts unknown toclay—the passage

of centuries has blunted them. Citizens in the true sense of the word, the

Athenians sensed the dangers posed by asocial behavior, and saw how
such behavior often disguises itself in other forms: the holier-tharythou attitude that silently seeks to impose its standards on others; overweening
ambition at the expense of the common good; the flaunting of superiority;

quiet scheming; terminal obnoxiousness. Some of these behaviors would
eat away at the city’s cohesion by creating factions and sowing dissension,

others would ruin the democratic spirit by making the common citizen
feel inferior and envious. The Athenians did not try to reeducate people
who acted in these ways, or to absorb them somehow into the group, or to

impose a violent punishment that would only create other problems. The
solution was quick and effective: Get rid of them.
Within any group, trouble can most often be traced to a single source,
the unhappy, chronically dissatisfied one who will always stir up dissension and infect the group with his or her ill ease. Before you know what hit

you the dissatisfaction spreads. Act before it becomes impossible to disentangle one strand of misery from another, or to see how the whole thing
started. First, recognize troublemakers by their overbearing presence, or

by their complaining nature. Once you spot them do not try to reform
them or appease them-—that will only make things worse. Do not attack
them, whether directly or indirectly, for they are poisonous in nature and
360

will work underground to destroy you. Do as the Athenians did: Banish
them before it is too late. Separate them from the group before they become

the eye of a whirlpool. Do not give them time to stir up anxieties

and sew discontent; do not give them room to move. Let one person suffer so that the rest can live in peace.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In 1296 the cardinals of the Catholic Church met in Rome to select a new

pope. They chose Cardinal Gaetani, for he was incomparably shrewd;
such a man would make the Vatican a great power. Taking the name Boni~
face VIII, Gaetani soon proved he deserved the cardinals’ high opinion of

him: He plotted his moves carefully in advance, and stopped at nothing to

get his way. Once in power, Boniface quickly crushed his rivals and unified the Papal States. The European powers began to fear him, and sent

delegates to negotiate with him. The German King Albrecht of Austria
even yielded some territory to Boniface. All was proceeding
according to
the pope’s plan.
One piece did not fall into place, however, and that was Tuscany, the
richest part of Italy. If Boniface could conquer Florence, Tuscany’s most
powerful city, the region would be his. But Florence was a proud republic,
and would be hard to defeat. The pope had to play his cards skillfully.
Florence was divided by two rival factions, the Blacks and the Whites.
The Whites were the merchant families that had recently and quickly

risen to power and wealth; the Blacks were the older money. Because of

their popularity with the people, the Whites retained control of the city, to
the Blacks’ increasing resentment. The feud between the two grew steadily
more bitter.

Here Boniface saw his chance: He would plot to help the Blacks take
over the

city, and Florence would be in his pocket. And as he studied the

situation he began to focus on one man, Dante Alighieri, the celebrated

writer, poet, and ardent supporter of the Whites. Dante had always been
interested in politics. He believed passionately in the republic, and often
chastised his fellow citizens for their lack of spine. He also happened to be
the city’s most eloquent public speaker. In 1300, the year Boniface began

plotting to take over Tuscany, Dante’s fellow citizens had voted him in to
Florence’s highest elected position, making him one of the city’s six priors. During his six-month term in the
post, he had stood firmly against the
Blacks and against all of the pope’s attempts to sow disorder.
By 1301, however, Boniface had a new plan: He called in Charles de
Valois, powerful brother of the king of France, to help bring order to Tus»
cany. As Charles marched through northern Italy, and Florence seethed
with anxiety and fear, Dante quickly emerged as the man who could rally

ately to arm the citizens and to organize resistance against the pope and
his puppet French prince. By hook or by crook, Boniface had to neutralize
Dante. And so, even as on the one hand he threatened Florence with
Charles de Valois, on the other he held out the olive branch, the possibil-

ity of negotiations, hoping Dante would take the bait. And indeed the Flov
rentines decided to send a delegation to Rome and try to negotiate a
peace. To head the mission, predictably, they chose Dante.
Some warned the poet that the wily pope was setting up a trap to lure
him away, but Dante went to Rome anyway, arriving as the French army
stood before the gates of Florence. He felt sure that his eloquence and ma»

but to promote your peace.” Succumbing to his powerful presence, the

Florentines listened as the pope promised to look after their interests. He
then advised them to return home, leaving one of their members behind
to continue the talks. Boniface signaled that the man to stay was to be

Dante. He spoke with the utmost politeness, but in essence it was an order.

And so Dante remained in Rome. And while he and the pope continued their dialogue, Florence fell apart. With no one to rally the Whites,
and with Charles de Valois using the pope’s money to bribe and sow dis-

sension, the Whites disintegrated, some arguing for negotiations, others
switching sides. Facing an enemy now divided and unsure of itself, the
Blacks easily destroyed them within weeks, exacting violent revenge on
them. And once the Blacks stood firmly in power, the pope finally dis-

missed Dante from Rome.

would crumble. He played the oldest card in the book—threatenix1g with

fell for it. Once the poet was in Rome, the pope kept him there for as long

it took. For Boniface understood one of the principal precepts in the

flock of sheep into a den of lions. So be isolated the troublemaker. Without the

KEYS TO POWER
In the past, an entire nation would be ruled by a king and his handful of
ministers. Only the elite had any power to play with. Over the centuries,

power has gradually become more and more diffused and democratized.
This has created, however, a common misperception that groups no

longer have centers of power——-that power is spread out and scattered
among many people. Actually, however, power has changed in its numbers but not in its essence. There may be fewer mighty tyrants command
ing the power of life and death over millions, but there remain thousands
of petty tyrants ruling smaller realms, and enforcing their will through indirect power games, charisma, and so on. In every group, power is con-

centrated in the hands of one or two people, for this is one area in which
human nature will never change: People will congregate around a single

strong personality like planets orbiting a sun.
To labor under the illusion that this kind of power center no longer
exists is to make endless mistakes, waste energy and time, and never hit

the target. Powerful people never waste time. Outwardly they may play

along with the game-—pretending that power is shared among manymbut
inwardly they keep their eyes on the inevitable few in the group who hold
the cards. These are the ones they work on, When troubles arise, they
look for the underlying cause, the single strong character who started the
stirring and whose isolation or banishment will settle the waters again.
In his fami1y~therapy practice, Dr. Milton H. Erickson found that if
the family dynamic was unsettled and dysfunctional there was inevitably
person who was the stirrer, the troublemaker. In his sessions he would
symbolically isolate this rotten apple by seating him or her apart from the
one

others, if only by a few feet. Slowly the other family members would see
the physically separate person as the source of their difficulty. Once you

recognize who the stirrer is, pointing it out to other people will accomplish
great deal. Understanding who controls the group dynamic is a critical
realization. Remember: Stirrers thrive by hiding in the group, disguising
a

their actions among the reactions of others. Render their actions visible
and they lose their power to upset.
A key element in games of strategy is isolating the enemy’s power. In
chess you try to comer the king. In the Chinese game of go you try to iso~

late the enemy’s forces in small pockets, rendering them immobile and ineffectual. It is often better to isolate your enemies than

to

LAW 42

363

them——you seem less brutal. The result, though, is the same, for in the
game of power, isolation spells death.
The most effective form of isolation is somehow to separate your victims from their power base. When Mao Tse—tung wanted to eliminate an

enemy in the ruling elite, he did not confront the person directly; be
silently and stealthily worked to isolate the man, divide his allies and turn
them away from him, shrink his support. Soon the man would vanish on

his own.
Presence and appearance have great import in the game of power. To
seduce, particularly in the beginning stages, you need to be constantly
present, or create the feeling that you are; if you are often out of sight, the
charm will wear oil”. Queen Ellzabeth’s prime minister, Robert Cecil,
had two main rivals: the queen’s favorite, the Earl of Essex, and her former favorite, Sir Walter Raleigh. He contrived to send them both on a
mission against Spain; with them away from the court he managed to
wrap his tentacles around the queen, secure his position as her top ad~
viser and weaken her affection for Raleigh and the earl. The lesson here
is twofold: First, your absence from the court spells danger for you, and

you should never leave the scene in a time of turmoil, for your absence
can both symbolize and induce a loss of power; second, and on the other

hand, luring your enemies away from the court at critical moments is a
great ploy.
Isolation has other strategic uses. When trying to seduce people, it is
often wise to isolate them from their usual social context. Once isolated

they are vulnerable to you, and your presence becomes magnified. Similarly, con artists often look for ways to isolate their marks from their nor
mal social milieux, steering them into new environments in which they
are no
longer comfortable. Here they feel weak, and succumb to decep~
tion more easily. Isolation, then, can prove a powerful way of bringing
people under your spell to seduce or swindle them.
You will often find powerful people who have alienated themselves
from the group. Perhaps their power has gone to their heads, and they
consider themselves superior; perhaps they have lost the knack of communicating with ordinary folk. Remember: This makes them vulnerable.
Powerful though they be, people like this can be turned to use.
The monk Rasputin gained his power over Czar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra of Russia through their tremendous isolation from the people. Alexandra in particular was a foreigner, and especially alienated
from everyday Russians; Rasputin used his peasant origins to insinuate
himself into her good graces, for she desperately wanted to communicate
with her subjects. Once in the court’s inner circle, Rasputin made himself
indispensable and attained great power. Heading straight for the center,
he aimed for the one figure in Russia who commanded power (the czarina
dominated her husband), and found he had no need to isolate her for the
work was already done. The Rasputin strategy can bring you great power:
Always search out people who hold high positions yet who find them364

selves isolated on the board‘ They are like apples falling into your lap,

easily seduced, and able to catapult you into power yourself.
Finally, the reason you strike at the shepherd is because such an action will djshearten the sheep beyond any rational measure. When Hetnando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro led their tiny forces against the Aztec
and Incan empires, they did not make the mistake of fighting on several
fronts, nor were they intimidated by the numbers arrayed against them;
they captured the kings, Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Vast empires fell
into their hands. With the leader gone the center of gravity is gone; there
is nothing to revolve around and everything falls apart. Aim at the leaders, bring them down, and look for the endless opportunities in the confusion that will ensue.

“Any harm you do to a man should be done in such a way that you need
revenge,” writes Machiavelli. If you act to isolate your enemy,
make sure he lacks the means to repay the favor. If you apply this Law, in

other words, apply it from a position of superiority, so that you have noth-

president,
Ulysses S. Grant as a troublesome member of his government. So he
isolated Grant, as a prelude to forcing him out. This only enraged the
great general, however, who responded by forming a support base in the
Republican party and going on to become the next president. It would
have been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where he could
do less harm, than to make him revengeful. And so you may often find it
better to keep people on your side, where you can watch them, than to
risk creating an angry enemy. Keeping them close, you can secretly whitsaw

Near the end of the reign of Louis XV, all of France seemed desperate for

change. When the king’s grandson and chosen successor, the future Louis
XVI, married the fifteen-year-old daughter of the empress of Austria, the
French caught a glimpse of the future that seemed hopeful. The young
bride, Ma.rie~Antoinette, was beautiful and full of life. She instantly
changed the mood of the court, which was rank with Louis XV’s dc»
baucheries; even the common people, who had yet to see her, talked excitedly of Marie-Antoinette. The French had grown disgusted with the series
of mistresses who had dominated Louis XV, and they looked forward to
sewing their new queen. In 1773, when Marie-Antoinette publicly rode
through the streets of Paris for the first time, applauding crowds swarmed
around her carriage. “How fortunate,” she wrote her mother, “to be in a

position in which one can gain widespread affection at so little cost.”
In 1774 Louis XV died and Louis XVI took the throne. As soon as
Maxie-Antninette became queen she abandoned herself to the pleasures
she loved the most—-ordering and wearing the most expensive gowns and

jewelry in the realm; sporting the most elaborate hair in history, her
sculpted coiffures rising as much as three feet above her head; and throwing
a constant succession of masked balls and fétes. All of these whims she
paid
for on credit, never concerning herself with the cost or who paid the bills.
Marie~Antoinette’s greatest pleasure was the creation and designing of
a
private Garden of Eden at the Petit Trianon, a chéteau on the grounds of
Versailles with its own woods. The gardens at the Petit Trianon were to be
as “natural” as
possible, including moss applied by hand to the trees and
rocks. To heighten the pastoral effect, the queen employed peasant milkmaids to milk the finestlooking cows in the realm; launderers and cheese
makers in special peasant outfits she helped design; shepherds to tend
sheep with silk ribbons around their necks. \'Vhen she inspected the bams,
she would watch her milkmaids squeezing milk into porcelain vases made
at the
royal ceramic works. To pass the time, Ma.rie«Antoinette would
flowers
in the woods around the Petit Trianon, or watch her “good
gather
peasants” doing their “chores.” The place became a separate world, its
community limited to her chosen favofites.
With each new whim, the cost of maintaining the Petit Trianon soared.
Meanwhile. France itself was deteriorating: There was famine and wide
spread discontent. Even socially insulated courtiers seethed with resentment-—the queen treated them like children. Only her favorites mattered,
and these were becoming fewer and fewer. But Marie~Antoinette did not
concern herself with this. Not once throughout her
reign did she read a
minister’s report. Not once did she tour the provinces and rally the people
to her side. Not once did she mingle among the Parisians, or receive a dc}
egation from them. She did none of these things because as queen she felt
the people owed her their affection, and she was not required to love them
in return.

In 1784 the queen became embroiled in a scandal. As part of an elaborate swindle, the most expensive diamond necklace in Europe had been

purchased under her name, and during the swindlers‘ trial her lavish
lifestyle became public: People heard about the money she spent on jewels
and dresses and masked dances. They gave her the nickname “Madame
Deficit,” and from then on she became the focus of the people‘s growing
resentment. When she appeared in her box at the opera the audience
greeted her with hisses. Even the court turned against her. For while she
had been running up her huge ezcpenditures, the country was headed for
rum.

Five years later, in 1789, an unprecedented event took place: the be

ginning of the French Revolution. The queen did not worry—-let the people have their little rebellion, she seemed to think; it would soon quiet

From early on, Marie—Antoinette acquired the most dangerous of attitudes:

In the realm of power, such attitudes are disastrous. At all times you

Wei had mounted an all~out attack on Shu from the north. More dangerous

still, Wei had formed an alliance with the barbarous states to the south of
Shu, led by King Menghuo. Chuko Liang had to deal with this second
menace from the south before he could

hope to fend off Wei in the north.

As Chuko Liang prepared to march south against the barbarians, a
wise man in his camp offered him advice. It would be impossible, this man

said, to pacify the region by force. Lizmg would probably beat Menghuo,
but as soon as he headed north again to deal with Wei, Menghuo would
reinvade. “It is better to win hearts," said the wise man, “than cities; better
to battle with hearts than with weapons. I hope you will succeed in winning
the hearts of these people.” “You read my thoughts,” responded Chuko

Liang.

ing the king himself. Instead of punishing or executing his prisoners, however, he separated the soldiers from their king, had their shackles removed,

regaled them with food and wine, and then addressed them. “You are all
upright men,” he said. “I believe you all have parents, wives, and children
waiting for you at home. They are doubtless shedding bitter tears at your
fate. I am going to release you, so that you can return home to your loved

and comfort them.” The men thanked Liang with tears in their eyes;
then he sent for Menghuo. “If 1 release you,” asked Liang, “what will you
ones

do?” “I will pull my army together again,” answered the king, “and lead it

against you to a decisive battle. But if you capture me a second time, I will
bow to your superiority.” Not only did Liang order Menghuo released, he
gave him a gift of a horse and saddle. When angry lieutenants wondered
why he did this, Liang told them, “I can capture that man as easily as I can
take something out of my pocket. I am trying to win his heart. When I do,

peace will come of itself here in the south.”
As Menghuo had said he would, he attacked again. But his own officers, whom Liang had treated so well, rebelled against him, captured him,

and turned him over to Liang, who asked him again the same question as

before. Menghuo replied that he had not been beaten fairly, but merely be-

trayed by his own officers; he would fight again, but if captured a third time
he would bow to Liang’s superiority.
Over the following months Liang outwitted Menghuo again and again,
capturing him a third, a fourth, and a fifth time. On each occasion Meng—
huo’s troops grew more dissatisfied. Liang had treated them with respect;
they had lost their heart for fighting. But every time Chuko Liang asked
Menghuo to yield, the great king would come up with another excuse: You
tricked me, I lost through bad luck, on and on. If you capture me again,
he would promise, I swear I will not betray you. And so Liang would let
him go.

When he captured Menghuo for the sixth time, he asked the king the

question again. “If you capture me a seventh time,” the king replied,
“I shall give you my loyalty and never rebel again.” “Very well,” said

Liang. “But if I capture you again, I will not release you.”
Now Menghuo and his soldiers fled to a far corner of their kingdom,
the region of Wuge. Defeated so many times, Menghuo had only one hope
left: He would ask the help of King Wutugu of Wuge, who had an immense
and ferocious army. Wutugu’s warriors wore an armor of tightly woven
vines soaked in

oil, then dried to an impenetrable hardness. With
Menghuo at his side, Wutugu marched this mighty army against Liang, and
this time the great strategist seemed frightened, leading his men in a hurried relreat. But he was merely leading Wutugu into a trap: He cornered
the king’s men in a narrow valley, then lit fires set all around them. When
the fires reached the soldiers Wutugu’s whole army burst into flame-the
oii in their armor, of course, being highly flammable. All of them perished.
Liang had managed to separate Mengliuo and his entourage from the
carnage in the valley, and the king found himself a captive for the seventh
time. After this slaughter Liang could not bear to face his prisoner again.
He sent a messenger to the captured king: “He has commissioned me to release you. Mobilize another army against him, if you can, and try once

defeat him.” Sobbing, the king fell to the ground, crawled to Liang
knees, and prostrated himself at his feet. “Oh great miniscried

Menghuo, “yours is the majesty of Heaven. We men of the south

Liang. “I, my sons, and my grandsons are deeply moved by Your Hon0r’s

Liang honored Menghuo with a great banquet, reestablished him on
the throne, restored his conquered lands to his rule, then returned north
with his army, leaving no occupying force. Liang never came back—he had
no need to:
Menghuo had become his most devoted and unshakable ally.

KEYS TO POWER
In the game of power, you are surrounded by people who have absolutely

help you unless it is in their interest to do so. And if you have
nothing to offer their selfiinterest, you are likely to make them hostile, for
they will see in you just one more competitor, one more waster of their
time. Those that overcome this prevailing coldness are the ones who find
the key that unlocks the stra.nger’s head and mind, seducing him into their
corner, if necessary sofiening him up for a punch. But most people never
no reason to

learn this side of the game. Vlrhen they meet someone new, rather than
stepping back and probing to see what makes this person unique, they talk
about themselves, eager to impose their own willpower and prejudices.
They argue, boast, and make a show of their power. They may not know it
but they are secretly creating an enemy, a resistor, because there is no
more infuriating feeling than having your individuality ignored, your own

psychology unacknowledged. It makes you feel lifeless and resentful.
Remember: The key to persuasion is softening people up and breakthem
down, gently. Seduce them with a two—pronged approach: Work
ing
on

their emotions and play on their intellectual weaknesses. Be alert to

both what separates them from everyone else (their individual psychology)
and what they share with everyone else (their basic emotional responses).
Aim at the primary emotions——love, hate, jealousy. Once you move their
emotions you have reduced their control, making them more vulnerable to

persuasion.
When Chuko Liang wanted to dissuade an important general of a rival
kingdom from entering into an alliance with Ts’ao Ts’ao, Liang’s dreaded
enemy, he did not detail "rm; Ts’ao’s cruelty, or attack him on moral
grounds. Instead Liang suggested that Ts’ao Ts’ao was really after the gen»

eral’s beautiful young wife. This hit the general in the gut, and won him
over.

Mao Tse—tung similarly always appealed to popular emotions, and

spoke in the simplest terms. Educated and well—rea.d himself, in his
speeches he used visceral metaphors, voicing the public’s deepest amdelies
and encouraging them to vent their frustrations in public meetings. Rather
than arguing the practical aspects of a. particular program, he would de~
scribe how it would affect them on the most primitive, down—to—earth level.
Do not believe that this approach works only with the illiterate and un-

sch0oled—it works on one and all. All of us are mortal and face the same
dreadful fate, and all of us share the desire for attachment and belonging.
Stir up these emotions and you captivate our hearts.
The best way to do this is with a dramatic jolt, of the kind that Chuko

Liang created when be fed and released prisoners who expected only the
worst from him. Shaking them to the core, he softened their hearts. Play on
contrasts like this: Push people to despair, then give them relief. If they ex~
pect pain and you give them pleasure, you win their hearts. Creating pleasure of any kind, in fact, will
usually bring you success, as will allaying fears
and providing or promising security.
Symbolic gestures are often enough to win sympathy and goodwill. A
gesture of self—sacri.fice, for example--a show that you suffer as those
around you do—will make people identify with you, even if your suffering
is symbolic or minor and theirs is real. When you enter a group, make a
gesture of goodwill; soften the group up for the harsher actions that will follow later.
When T. E. Lawrence was fighting the Turks in the deserts of the Middle East during World War I, he had an epiphany: It seemed to him that
Conventional warfare had lost its value. The old-fashioned soldier was lost
in the enormous amiies of the time, in which he was ordered about like a

lifeless pawn. Lawrence wanted to turn this around. For him, every soldier’s mind was a kingdom he had to conquer. A committed, psychologi-

cally motivated soldier would fight harder and more creatively than a.
puppet.
Lawrence’s perception is still more true in the world today, where so
many of us feel alienated, anonymous, and suspicious of authority, all of
which makes overt power plays and force even more counterproductive

and dangerous. Instead of manipulating lifeless pawns, make those on your
side convinced and excited by the cause you have enlisted them in; this
will not only make your work easier but it will also give you more leeway
to deceive them later on. And to

accomplish this you need to deal with

their individual psychologies. Never clumsily assume that the tactic that
worked on one person will necessarily work on another. To find the key
that will motivate them, first get them to open up. The more they talk, the
more

they reveal about their likes and dislikes--the handles and levers to

move them with.

The quickest way to secure people’s minds is by demonstrating, as

simply as possible, how an action will benefit them. Self—interest is the
‘

LAW 43

3'73

strongest motive of all: A great cause may capture minds, but once the firs:
flush of excitement is over, interest will flag--unless there is something to
be gained. Self-interest is the solider foundation. The causes that work best
use a noble veneer to cover a blatant

appeal to self-interest; the cause se-

duces but the self-interest secures the deal.

The people who are best at appealing to people’s minds are often

artists, intellectuals, and those of a more poetic nature. This is because
ideas are most easily communicated through metaphors and imagery. It is
always good policy, then, to have in your pocket at least one artist or intel~
lectual who can appeal concretely to people’s minds. Kings have always

kept a stable of writers in their ham: Frederick the Great had his Voltaire
(until they quaneled and separated), Napoleon won over Goethe. Conversely, Napoleon III’s alienation of writers such as Victor Hugo, whom he
exiled from France, contributed to his growing unpopularity and eventual
downfall. It is dangerous, then, to alienate those who have powers of ex»
pression, and useful to pacify and exploit them.
Finally, learn to play the numbers game‘ The wider your support base
the stronger your power. Understanding that one alienated, disaffected
soul can spark a blaze of discontent, Louis XIV made sure to endear him-

self to the lowest members of his staff. You too must constantly win over
more allies on all levels-we time will

inevitably come when you will need

Mirrors have the power to disturb us. Gazing at our reflection in the mir~

the wrinkles and blemishes. But if we do look hard at the reflected image,

There are four main Mirror Effects in the realm of power:
The

Neutralizing Eflect. In ancient Greek mythology, the Gorgon

Medusa had serpents for hair, protruding tongue, massive teeth, and a face

ugly that anyone who gazed at her was turned into stone, out of fright.
But the hero Perseus managed to slay Medusa by polishing his bronze
shield into a mirror, then using the reflection in the mirror to guide him as
he crept up and cut off her head without looking at her directly. If the
so

shield in this instance was a mirror, the mirror also was a kind of shield:

This is the essence of the Neutralizing Eifect: Do what your enemies

do, following their actions as best you can, and they cannot see what you
are
up to—they are blinded by your mirror. Their strategy for dealing with
you depends on your reacting to them in a way characteristic of you; new
tralize it by playing a game of mimicry with them. The tactic has a mock—
ing, even infuriating effect. Most of us remember the childhood experience
of someone teasing us by repeating our words exactly-—after a while, usu-

ally not long, we wanted to punch them in the face. Working more subtly
as an adult, you can still unsettle
your opponents this way; shielding your
own strategy with the mirror, you
lay invisible traps, or push your opponents into the trap they planned for you.
This powerful technique has been used in military strategy since the
days of Sun-tzu; in our own time it often appears in political campaigning.
It is also useful for disguising those situations in which you have no particular strategy yourself. This is the Wa.rn‘or’s Mirror.
A reverse version of the Neutralizing Effect is the Shadow: You

shadow your opponents’ every move without their seeing you. Use the
Shadow to gather information that will neutralize their strategy later on,

when you will be able to thwart their every move. The Shadow is effective
because to follow the movements of others is to gain valuable insights into
their habits and routines. The Shadow is the preeminent device for detectives and spies.

The Narcissus Eflect.

Gazing at an image in the waters of a pond, the

Greek youth Narcissus fell in love with it. And when he found out that the

image was his own reflection, and that he therefore could not consummate
his love, he despaired and drowned himself. All of us have a similar problem: We are profoundly in love with ourselves, but since this love excludes
a love
object outside ourselves, it remains continuously unsatisfied and unfulfilled. The Narcissus Effect plays on this universal narcissism: You look
deep into the souls of other people; fathom their inmost desires, their values, their tastes, their spirit; and you reflect it back to them, making yourself into a kind of mirror image. Your ability to reflect their psyche gives
you great power over them; they may even feel a tinge of love.
This is simply the ability to mimic another person not physically, but

psychologically, and it is immensely powerful because it plays upon the
unsatisfied se1f—love of a child. Normally, people bombard us with their experiences, their tastes. They hardly ever make the effort to see things
through our eyes. This is annoying, but it also creates great opportunity: If
you can show you understand another person by reflecting their inmost
feelings, they will be entranced and disarmed, all the more so because it
happens so rarely. No one can resist this feeling of being harmoniously reflected in the outside world, even though you might well be manufacturing
it for their benefit, and for deceptive purposes of your own.
The Narcissus Effect works wonders in both social life and business; it
gives us both the Seducer’s and the Coum'er’s Mirror.

The Moral Effect. The power of verbal argument is extremely limited,
and often accomplishes the opposite of what is intended. As Gracién re-

marks, “The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.” The Moral Effect is a

perfect way to demonstrate your ideas through action. Quite simply, you
teach others a lesson by giving them a taste of their own medicine.
In the Moral Effect, you mirror what other people have done to you,
and do so in a way that makes them realize you are doing to them exactly
what they did to you. You make them feel that their behavior has been unpleasant, as opposed to hearing you complain and whine about it, which
only gets their defenses up. And as they feel the result of their actions mir~
rored back at them, they realize in the profoundest sense how they hurt or
punish others with their unsocial behavior. You objectify the qualifies you
want them to feel ashamed of and create a mirror in which they can gaze at
their follies and learn a lesson about themselves. This technique is often
used by educators, psychologists, and anyone who has to deal with un-

pleasant and unconscious behavior. This is the Teacher’s Mirror. Vifhether

and citizens of all classes to his side and chasing his successor, King Louis

XVIII, off the throne‘ By March, however, having reestablished himselfin
power, he had to face the fact that France’s situation had gravely changed.
The country was devastated, he had no allies among the other European

nations, and his most loyal and important ministers had deserted him or
left the country. Only one man remained from the old regin-ie—joseph
Fouché, his former minister of police.
Napoleon had relied on Fouché to do his dirty work throughout his
previous reign, but he had never been able to figure his minister out. He
kept a corps of agents to spy on all of his ministers, so that he would always
have an edge on them, but no one had gotten anything on Fouché. If sus~

shoot him then and there unless he confessed; the man broke down and

ink, arranging for a secret meeting of special agents in Basel. Napoleon arscordingly ordered one of his own agents to infiltrate this meeting. If Fouché
was indeed
planning to betray him, he would finally be caught red-handed
and would hang.

Napoleon waited impatiently for the agent’s return, but to his bewilderment the agent showed up days later reporting that he had heard nothing that would implicate Fouché in a conspiracy. In fact it seemed that the
other agents present suspected Fouché of double-crossing them, as if he
were

working for Napoleon all along. Napoleon did not believe this for an

instant—Fouché had somehow outwitted him again.
The following morning Fouché visited Napoleon, and remarked, “By
the way, sire, I never told you that I had a letter from Metternich a few

days ago; my mind was so full of things of greater moment. Besides, his
emissary omitted to give me the powder needed to make the writing legiHere at length is the letter.” Sure that Fouché was toying with him,
ble.
Napoleon exploded, “You are a traitor, Fouché! I ought to have you
hanged.” He continued to harangue Fouché, but could not fire him without
proof. Fouché only expressed amazement at the emperor’s words, but inwardly he smiled, for all along he had been playing a mirroring game.
.

.

.

Interpretation
Fouché had known for years that Napoleon kept on top of those around

him by spying on them day and night. The minister had survived this game

by having his own spies spy on Napoleon’s spies, thus neutralizing any action Napoleon might take against him. In the case of the meeting in Basel,
he even turned the tables: Knowing about Napoleorfs double agent, he set
it up so that it would appear as if Fouché were a loyal double agent too.
Fouché gained power and flourished in a period of great tumult by
mirroring those around him. Duning the French Revolution he was a radical jacobin; after the Terror he became a moderate republican; and under
Napoleon he became a committed imperialist whom Napoleon ennobled
and made the duke of Otranto. If Napoleon took up the weapon of digging
up dirt on people, Fouché made sure he had the dirt on Napoleon, as well
as on
everyone else. This also allowed him to predict the emperor’s plans
and desires, so that he could echo his boss’s sentiments before he had even

uttered them. Shielding his actions with a mirror strategy, Fouché could
also plot offensive moves without being caught in the act.
This is the power of mirroring those around you. First, you give people

the feeling that you share their thoughts and goals. Second, if they suspect
you have ulterior motives, the mirror shields you from them, preventing
them from figuring out your strategy. Eventually this will infuriate and un-

settle them. By playing the double, you steal their thunder, suck away their

initiative, make them feel helpless. You also gain the ability to choose when
and how to unsettle them—anot.her avenue to power. And the mirror saves
you mental energy: simply echoing the moves of others gives you the
space you need to develop a strategy of your own.

Observance II

Early on in his career, the ambitious statesman and general Alcibiades of
Athens (450—404 8.0) fashioned a formidable weapon that became the
source of his

power. In every encounter with others, he would sense their
moods and tastes, then carefully tailor his words and actions to mirror their
inmost desires. He would seduce them with the idea that their values were

superior to everyone else’s, and that his goal was to model himself on them
or help them realize their dreams. Few could resist his charm.
The first man to fall under his spell was the philosopher Socrates. Alcibiades represented the opposite of the Socratic ideal of simplicity and uprightness: He lived lavishly and was completely unprincipled. Whenever
he met Socrates, however, he mirrored the older man’s sobriety, eating
simply, accompanying Socrates on long walks, and talking only of philosophy and virtue. Socrates was not completely fooled——he was not unaware
of Alcibiades’ other life. But that only made him vulnerable to a logic that
flattered him: Only in my presence, he felt, does this man submit to a. virtuous influence;
only I have such power over him. This feeling intoxicated

himself. The speeches gave expression to young Athenians’ thirst to com
quer lands for themselves, rather than living off the victories of their a.nces~
tors. But he also tailored his words to reflect older men's nostalgia for the
glory years when Athens led the Greeks against Persia, and then went on to
create an empire. All Athens now dreamed of conquering

Sicily; Alcibi-

ades’ plan was approved, and he was made the expedition’s commander.
While Alcibiades was leading the invasion of Sicily, however, certain
Athenians fabricated charges against him of profaning sacred statues. He
knew his enemies would have him executed if he returned home, so at the

last minute he deserted the Athenian fleet and defected to Athens’s bitter
enemy, Sparta. The Spartans welcomed this great man to their side, but
they knew his reputation and were wary of him. Alcibiades loved luxury;

make her pregnant. When this became public he once more had to flee

This time Alcibiades defected to Persia, where he suddenly went from

Spartan simplicity to embracing the lavish Persian lifestyle down to the last
detail. It was of course immensely flattering to the Persians to see a Greek
of Alcibiades’ stature prefer their culture over his own, and they showered
him with honors, land, and power. Once seduced by the mirror, they failed
to notice that behind this shield Alcibiades was playing a double game, secretly helping the Athenians in their war with Sparta and thus reingrafiab

It is worth noting, however, the dangers in the promiscuous use of the

saw

him mirroring completely different people as totally as he had mir-

of the Mirror Effect made whole peoples feel used, so that he constantly

Spartans that they finally had him murdered. He had gone Loo far. The Seducer’s Mirror must be used with caution and discrimination.

Marie studied the future king closely. She noticed that her sisters’ frivolity

The key to Louis’s heart, Marie saw, would be to construct a mirror reflecting his fantasies and his youthful yeamings for glory and romance. To
begin with she immersed herself in the romantic novels, poems, and plays
that she knew the young ldng read voraciously. When Louis began to engage her in conversation, to his delight she would talk of the things that
stirred his soul——not this fashion or that piece of gossip, but rather courtly
love, the deeds of great knights, the nobility of past kings and heroes. She

LAW 4 4

383

Interpretation
Marie Mancini played the seducer’s game to perfection. First, she took a

step back, to study her prey. Seduction often fails to get past the first step
because it is too aggressive; the first move must always be a retreat. By

studying the king from a distance Marie saw what distinguished him from
others»-—his high ideals, romantic nature, and snobbish disdain for petty
politics. Marie’s next step was to make a mirror for these hidden yearnings
on Louis’s
part, letting him glimpse what he himself could be——-a godlike
king!
This mirror had several functions: Satisfying Louis’s ego by giving him
a double to look at, it also focused on him so
exclusively as to give him the
feeling that Marie existed for him alone. Surrounded by a pack of schem~
ing courtiers who only had their own self—interest at heart, he could not fail
to be touched by this devotional focus. Finally Marie-’s mirror set up an
ideal for him to live up to: the noble knight of the medieval court. To a soul
both romantic and ambitious, nothing could be more intoxicating than to
have someone hold up an idealized reflection of him. In effect it was Marie
Mancini who created the image of the Sun King——indeed Louis later ad»
mitted the enormous part she had played in fashioning his radiant self»

image.
This is the power of the Seducefs Mirror: By doubling the tastes and
ideals of the target, it shows your attention to his or her psychology, an attention more charming than any aggressive pursuit. Find out what sets the

other person apart, then hold up the mirror that will reflect it and bring it
out of them. Feed their fantasies of power and greatness

by reflecting their

ideals, and they will succumb.
Observance IV
In 1538, with the death of his mother, Helena, the eight-year-old future
czar Ivan IV (or Ivan the Terrible) of Russia became an orphan. For the
next five years he watched as the

princely class, the boyars, terrorized the
country. Now and then, to mock the young Ivan, they would make him
wear a crown and
scepter and place him on the throne. VVhen the little
feet
over the
boy's
dangled
edge of the chair, they would laugh and lift him
off it, handing him from man to man in the air, making him feel his help
lessness compared to them.
When Ivan was thirteen, he boldly murdered the boyar leader and as-

cended to the throne. For the next few decades he struggled to subdue the

boyars’ power, but they continued to defy him. By 1575 his efforts to transform Russia and defeat its enemies had exhausted him. Meanwhile, his

subjects were complaining bitterly about his endless wars, his secret police,
the unvanquished and oppressive boyars. His own ministers began to question his moves. Finally he had had enough. In 1564 he had temporarily

abandoned the throne, forcing his subjects to call him back to power. Now
he took the strategy a step further, and abdicated.
To take his place Ivan elevated a general of his, Simeon Bekbulatovich,

384

LAW 41¢

to the throne. But

although Simeon had recently converted to Christianity,

he was by birth a Tartar, and his enthronement was an insult to Ivan’s subjects, since Russians looked down on the Tartars as inferiors and infidels.
Yet Ivan ordered that all Russians, including the boyars, pledge obedience
to their new ruler. And while Simeon moved into the Kremlin, Ivan lived

in a humble house on Moscow’s outskirts, from which he would sometimes
\n‘sit the palace, bow before the throne, sit among the other boyars, and

humbly petition Simeon for favors.
Over time it became clear that Simeon was a kind of kings double. He
dressed like Ivan, and acted like Ivan, but he had no real power, since no
one would

really obey him. The boyars at the court who were old enough

For two long years Ivan held the mirror of Simeon up to the Russian

people. The mirror said: Your whining and disobedience have made me a
czar

with no real power, so I will reflect back to you a czar with no real

power. You have treated me disrespectfully, so I will do the same to you,
making Russia the laughingstock of the world. In 1577, in the name of the

Russian people, the chastised boyars once again begged Ivan to return to
the throne, which he did. He lived as czar until his death, in 1584, and the

conspiracies, complaining, and second—guessing disappeared along with
Simeon.

Interpretation
In 15 64, after threatening to abdicate, Ivan had been granted absolute powers.

But these powers had slowly been chipped away as every sector of so-

ciety—the boyars, the church, the government—vied for more control.
Foreign wars had exhausted the country, internal bickering had increased,
and Ivan’s attempts to respond had been met with scorn. Russia had turned
into a kind of boisterous classroom in which the pupils laughed openly at
the teacher. If he raised his voice or complained, he only met more resistance. He had to teach them a lesson, give them a taste of their own medi-

cine. Simeon Bekbulatovich was the mirror he used to do so.

After two years in which the throne had been an object of ridicule and

disgust, the Russian people learned their lesson. They wanted their czar
back, conceding to him all the dignity and respect that the position should
always have commanded. For the rest of his reign, Russia and Ivan got
along fine.
Understand: People are locked in their own experiences. When you
whine about some insensitivity on their part, they may seem to understand,
but inwardly they are untouched and even more resistant. The goal of
power is always to lower people’s resistance to you. For this you need
tricks, and one trick is to teach them a lesson.
Instead of haranguing people verbally, then, create a kind of mirror of
their behavior, In doing so you leave them two choices: They can ignore

you, you will have planted a seed in their unconscious that will eventually

take root. When you mirror their behavior, incidentally, do not be afraid to
add a touch of caricature and exaggeration, as Ivan did by enthroning a

Dr. Milton H. Erickson, a pioneer in strategic psychotherapy, would often
educate his patients powerfully but indirectly by creating a kind of mirror
effect. Constructing an analogy to make patients see the truth on their own,

he would bypass their resistance to change. When Dr. Erickson treated
married couples complaining of sexual problems, for instance, he often
found that psychotherapy’s tradition of direct confrontation and problem-

airing only heightened the spouses’ resistance and sharpened their differInstead, he would draw a husband and wife out on other topics,
often banal ones, trying to find an analogy for the sexual conflict.
In one couple’s first session, the pair were discussing their eating
habits, especially at dinner. The wife preferred the leisurely approach——a
drink before the meal, some appetizers, and then a small main course, all at
a slow, civilized
pace. This frustrated the husband-—he wanted to get dinences.

ner over

quickly and to dig right into the main course, the bigger the better.

As the conversation continued, the couple began to catch glimpses of an

analogy to their problems in bed. The moment they made this connection,
however, Dr. Erickson would change the subject, carefully avoiding a discussion of the real problem.

The couple thought Erickson was just getting to know them and would
deal with the problem directly the next time he saw them. But at the end of

this first session, Dr. Erickson directed them to arrange a dinner a few

nights away that would combine each person’s desire: The wife would get
the slow meal, including time spent bonding, and the husband would get
the big dishes he wanted to eat. Without realizing they were acting under
the doctor’s gentle guidance, the couple would walk into a mirror of their
problem, and in the mirror they would solve their problems themselves,
ending the evening just as the doctor had h0ped—by mirroring the improved dinner dynamics in bed.
In dealing with more severe problems, such as the schizophrenids
mirror fantasy world of his or her own construction, Dr. Erickson would always try to enter the mirror and work within it, He once treated a hospital
inmate who believed he was Jesus Christ-—draping sheets around his
body, talking in vague parables, and bombarding staff and patients with
endless Christian proselytizing. No therapy or drugs seemed to work, until
one
day Dr. Erickson went up to the young man and said, “I understand
you have had experience as a carpenter.” Being Christ, the patient had to
say that he had had such experience, and Erickson immediately put him to
work building bookcases and other useful items, allowing him to wear his
Jesus garb. Over the next weeks, as the patient worked on these projects,
386

LAW 44

his mind became less occupied with Jesus fantasies and more focused on
his labor. As the carpentry work took precedence, a psychic shift took effect: The religious fantasies remained, but faded comfortably into the background, allowing the man to fimction in society.
Interpretation
Communication depends on metaphors and symbols, which are the basis
of language itself. A metaphor is a kind of mirror to the concrete and real,
which it often expresses more clearly and deeply than a literal description
does. When you are dealing with the intractable willpower of other people,
direct communication often only heightens their resistance.
This happens most clearly when you complain about people’s behavior, particularly in sensitive areas such as their lovemaking. You will effect
a. far more lasting change if, like Dr. Erickson, you construct an analogy, a
symbolic mirror of the situation, and guide the other through it. As Christ
himself understood, talking in parables is often the best way to teach a lesson, for it allows people to realize the truth on their own.
When dealing with people who are lost in the reflections of fantasy
worlds (including a host of people who do not live in mental hospitals),
never
try to push them into reality by shattering their mirrors. Instead,
enter their world and operate inside it, under their rules, gently guiding
them out of the hall of mirrors they have entered.

sixteenth~century Japanese tea master Takeno Sho~o once
passed by a house and noticed a. young man watering flowers near his front
gate. Two things caught Sho—o’s attention——first, the graceful] way the man
performed his task; and, second, the stunningly beautiful rose of Sharon
blossoms that bloomed in the garden. He stopped and introduced himself
The great

to the man, whose name was Sen no Rikyu. Sho—o wanted to stay, but he

had a prior engagement and had to hnny off. Before he left, however,

Rikyu invited him to take tea with him the following morning. Sho-o happily accepted.
When Sho—o opened the garden gate the next day, he was horrified to
see that not a single flower remained. More than
anything else, he had
come to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that he had not had the time to ap

preciate the day before; now, disappointed, he started to leave, but at the
gate he stopped himself, and decided to enter Sen no Rikyu’s tea room. Immediately inside, he stopped in his tracks and gazed in astonishment: Before him a vase hung from the ceiling, and in the vase stood a single rose of
Sharon blossom, the most beautiful in the garden. Somehow Sen no Rikyu
had read his guesfs thoughts, and, with this one eloquent gesture, had
demonstrated that this day guest and host would be in perfect harmony.
Sen no Rikyu went on to become the most famous tea. master of all,
and his trademark was this uncanny ability to harmonize himself with his
guests’ thoughts and to think one step ahead, enchanting them by adapting
to their taste.

One day Rjkyu was invited to tea by Yamashina Hechigwan, an ad‘

LAW 44

-1

38 z

miter of the tea ceremony but also a man with a vivid sense of humor.
When Rikyu arrived at Hechigwan’s home, he found the garden gate shut,
so

he opened it to look for the host. On the other side of the gate he saw

that someone had first dug a ditch, then carefully covered it over with canvas and

earth. Realizing that Hechigwan had planned a practical joke, he
obligingly walked right into the ditch, muddying his clothes in the process.
Apparently horrified, Hechigwan came running out, and hurried
Rikyu to a bath that for some inexplicable reason stood already prepared.
Afier bathing, Rikyu joined Hechigwan in the tea ceremony, which both
enjoyed immensely, sharing a laugh about the accident. Later Sen no
Rikyu explained to a friend that he had heard about Hechigwan’s practical
joke beforehand, “But since it should always be one’s aim to conform to
the wishes of one’s host, I fell into the hole knowingly and thus assured the
success of the
meeting. Tea is by no means mere obsequiousness, but there
is no tea where the host and guest are not in harmony with one another.”
Hechigwan’s vision of the dignified Sen no Rikyu at the bottom of a ditch
had pleased him endlessly, but Rikyu had gained a pleasure of his own
in complying with his host’s wish and watching him amuse himself in
this way.

Interpretation
Sen no Rikyu was no magician or seer~—-he watched those around him
acutely, plumbing the subtle gestures that revealed a hidden desire, then
producing that desire’s image. Although Sho—o never spoke of being enchanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it in his eyes. If mirroring a person’s desires meant falling into a ditch, so be it. Rikyu’s power
resided in his skillful use of the Courtier’s Mirror, which gave him the ap-

pearance of an unusual ability to see into other people.
Learn to manipulate the Courtier’s Mirror, for it will bring you great
power. Study people’s eyes, follow their gestures—-«surer barometers of pain
and pleasure than any spoken word. Notice and remember the details-«the

clothing, the choice of friends, the daily habits, the tossed-out remarks-—
that reveal hidden and rarely indulged desires. Soak it all in, find out what
lies under the surface, then make yourself the mirror of their unspoken
selves. That is the key to this power: The other person has not asked for
your consideration, has not mentioned his pleasure in the rose of Sharon,
and when you reflect it back to him his pleasure is heightened because it is
unasked for. Remember: The wordless communication, the indirect com~

pliment, contains the most power. No one can resist the enchantment of the
Courtier’s Mirror.

Yellow Kid Weil, con artist extraordinaire, used the Deceiver’s Mirror in
his most brilliant cons. Most audacious of all was his recreation of a bank
in Muncie, Indiana. When Weil read one day that the Merchants Bank in

Muncie had moved, he saw an opportunity he could not pass up.
Well rented out the original Merchants building, which still contained
bank furnitnure, complete with teller windows. He bought money bags,
358

stenciled a bank’s invented name on them, filled them with steel washers,
and arrayed them impressively behind the teller windows, along with bun-

dles of boodlevwreal bills hiding newspaper cut to size. For his banl<’s staff
and customers Weil hired gamblers, bookies, girls from local bawdy
houses, and other assorted confederates. He even had a local thug pose as a
bank dick.

Claiming to be the broker for a certificate investment the bank was offering, Weil would fish the waters and hook the proper wealthy sucker. He
would bring this man to the bank and ask to see the president. An “officer”
of the bank would tell them that they had to wait, which only heightened
the realism of the con-——one always has to wait to see the bank president.
And as they waited the bank would bustle with banklike activity, as call
girls and bookies in disguise floated in and out, making deposits and with»
drawals and tipping their hats to the phony bank dick. Lulled by this per~
feet copy of reality, the sucker would deposit $50,000 into the fake bank
without a worry in the world.
Over the years Weil did the same thing with at deserted yacht club, an
abandoned brokerage office, a relocated real estate office, and a com»

pletely realistic gambling club.
Interpretation
The mirroring of reality offers immense deceptive powers. The right uni»
form, the perfect accent, the proper props——the deception cannot be deci~
phered because it is enmeshed in a simulation of reality. People have an
intense desire and need to believe, and their first instinct is to trust a. well»

constructed facade, to mistake it for reality. After all, we cannot go around

doubting the reality of everything we seewthat would be too exhausting.
We habitually accept appearances, and this is a credulity you can use.
In this particular game it is the first moment that counts the most. If

your suckers’ suspicions are not raised by their first glance at the mirror’s
reflection, they will stay suppressed. Once they enter your hall of mirrors,

they will be unable to distinguish the real from the fake, and it will become
easier and easier to deceive them. Remember: Study the world’s surfaces
and learn to mirror them in your habits, your manner, your clothes. Like a
carnivorous plant, to unsuspecting insects you will look like all the other

plants in the field.

In 1864 the composer Richard Wagner moved to Munich at the behest

Bavaria. Ludwig was Wagner‘s biggest fan and most generous patron. The

Wagner moved into a lavish house, which the king eventually bought
for him. This house was but a stone’s throw from the former home of Lola

Montez, the notorious courtesan who had plunged Ludwig II’s grandfather
into a crisis that had forced him to abclicate. Warned that he could be in-

fected by this association, Wagner only scoffed-——-“I am no Lola Montez,"
he said. Soon enough, however, the citizens of Munich began to resent the

favors and money showered on Wagner, and dubbed him “the second

Lola,” or “Lolotte.” He unconsciously began to tread in Lo1a’s footstepsspending money extravagantly, meddling in matters beyond music, even
dabbling in politics and advising the king on cabinet appointments. Meanwhile Ludwigs affection for Wagner seemed intense and undignified for a

l-:ing——just like his grandfather’s love for Lola Montez.

Eventually Ludwig’s ministers wrote him a letter: “Your Majesty now
stands at a fateful parting of the ways: you have to choose between the love
and respect of your faithful people and the ‘friendship’ of Richard Wagner.” In December of 1865, Ludwig politely asked his friend to leave and

Avoid such association-effects like the plague. In a mirrored situation

you have little or no control over the reflections and recollections that will
be connected to you, and any situation beyond your control is dangerous.
Even if the person or event has positive associations, you will suffer from

the year IL!‘ an ancient

king with excommunication. The king’s most powerful minister, Cardinal
Wolsey, also saw no need for divorce—-—-and his halfhearted support of the
king cost him his position and soon his life.
One man in Hem-y’s cabinet, Thomas Cromwell, not only supported
him in his desire for a divorce but had an idea for realizing it: a complete
break with the past. He convinced the king that by severing ties with Rome
and making himself the head of a newly formed English church, he could
divorce Catherine and marry Anne. By I531 Henry saw this as the only solution. To reward Cromwell for his simple but brilliant idea, he elevated
this son of a blacksmith to the post of royal councillor.
By 1534 Cromwell had been named the king’s secretary, and as the
power behind the throne he had become the most powerful man in England. But for him the break with Rome went

beyondthe satisfaction of the

l<ing‘s carnal desires: He envisioned a new Protestant order in England,
with the power of the Catholic Church smashed and its vast wea.lth in the

hands of the king and the government. In that same year he initiated a
complete survey of the churches and monasteries of England. And as it
turned out, the treasures and moneys that the churches had accumulated
the centuries were far more than he had imagined; his spies and
agents came back with astonishing figures.

breaking up the monasteries, he began to seize their holdings and to put
them out of existence one by one. At the same time, he began to impose

Protestantism, introducing reforms in religious ritual and punishing those
who stuck to Catholicism, and who now were called heretics. Virtually

overnight, England was converted to a new official religion.
A terror fell on the country. Some people had suffered under the
Catholic Church, which before the reforms had been immensely powerful,
but most Britons had strong ties to Catholicism and to its comforting rituals. They watched in horror as churches were demolished, images of the
Madonna and saints were broken in pieces, stainedglass windows were

smashed, and the churches’ treasures were confiscated. With monasteries
that had succored the poor suddenly gone, the poor now flooded the
streets. The growing ranks of the beggar class were further swelled by for
mer monks. On

clesiastical reforms.

Sensing his fall from grace, in 1540 Cromwell decided to regain
Henry’s favor with one throw of the dice: He would End the king a new
wife. Henry’s third wife, Jane Seymour, had died a few years before, and
he had been pining for a new young queen. It was Cromwell who found
him one: Anne of Cleves, a German princess and, most important to
Cromwell, a Protestant. On Crornwell’s commission, the painter Holbein
produced a flattering portrait of Anne; when Henry saw it, he fell in love,
and agreed to marry her. Cromwell seemed back in favor.
Unfortunately, however, Holbein’s painting was highly idealized, and
when the king finally met the princess she did not please him in the least.
His anger against Cromwell—f1rst for the ill~conceived reforms, now for

saddling him with an unattractive and Protestant wife-—could no longer be
contained. In June of that year, Cromwell was arrested, charged as a Protestant extremist and a heretic, and sent to the Tower. Six weeks later, before a

change, he would become the leader of the new order, making the king de
pendent on him. But there was a problem in his strategy: Like a billiard
ball hit too hard against the cushion, his reforms had reactions and caroms
he did not envision and could not control.
The man who initiates strong reforms often becomes the scapegoat for

any kind of dissatisfaction. And eventually the reaction to his reforms may
consume him, for change is upsetting to the human animal, even when it is
for the good. Because the world is and always has been full of insecurity

and threat, we latch on to familiar faces and create habits and rituals to
make the world more comfortable.

Change can be pleasant and even

sometimes desirable in the abstract, but too much of it creates an anxiety

that will stir and boil beneath the surface and then eventually erupt.
Never underestimate the hidden conservatism of those around you. It
is powerful and entrenched. Never let the seductive charm of an idea cloud

your reason: just as you cannot make people see the world your way, you
cannot wrench them into the future with painful changes. They will rebel.
If reform is necessary, anticipate the reaction against it and find ways to

disguise the change and sweeten the poison.
OBSERVANCE. OF THE LAW
As a young Communist in the 19203, Mao Tsetung understood better than

any of his colleagues the incredible odds against a Communist victory in
394

LAW 45

China. With their small numbers, limited funds, lack of military experience, and small arsenal of weapons, the Party had no hope of success un-

less it won

over

China’s immense peasant population. But who in the

world was more conservative, more rooted in tradition, than the Chinese

peasantry? The oldest civilization on the planet had a history that would
never loosen its

power, no matter how violent the revolution. The ideas of
Confucius remained as alive in the 19203 as they had been in the sixth cen-

tury B.C., when the philosopher was alive, Despite the oppressions of the
current system, would the peasantry ever give up the deep~rooted values of
the past for the great unknown of Communism?
The solution, as Mao saw it, involved a simple deception: Cloak the
revolution in the clothing of the past, making it comforting and legitimate
in people’s eyes. One of Mao’s favorite books was the very popular me

dieval Chinese novel 77:: Water Margin, which recounts the exploits of a

Chinese Robin Hood and his robber band as they struggle against a cor-

rupt and evil monarch. In China in Mao’s time, family ties dominated over
any other kind, for the Confucian hierarchy of father and oldest son remained firmly in place; but The Witter Margin preached a superior valuethe fraternal ties of the band of robbers, the nobility of the cause that unites

people beyond blood. The novel had great emotional resonance for Chi~
nese
people, who love to root for the underdog. Time and again, then,
Mao would present his revolutionary army as an extension of the robber
band in The I'V1terMargz'n, likening his struggle to the timeless conflict between the oppressed peasantry and an evil emperor. He made the past
seem to
envelop and legitimize the Communist cause; the peasantry could
feel comfortable with and even support a group with such roots in the past.
Even once the Party came to power, Mao continued to associate it with
the past. He presented himself to the masses not as a Chinese Lenin but as
a.

modem Chuko Liang, the real»life third-century strategist who figures

prominently in the popular historical novel The Romance of the Wtree King~
dams. Liang was more than a great general—he was a poet, a philosopher,
and a figure of stem moral rectitude. So Mao represented himself as a poetwanior like Liang, a man who mixed strategy with philosophy and
preached a new ethics. He made himself appear like a hero from the great
Chinese tradition of warrior statesmen.

Soon, everything in Mao’s speeches and writings had a reference to an
earlier period in Chinese history. He recalled, for example, the great Emperor Ch’in, who had unified the country in the third century B.C. Ch’in
had burned the works of Confucius, consolidated and completed the building of the Great Wall, and given his name to China, Like Ch’in, Mao also
had brought the country together, and had sought bold reforms against an

oppressive past. Ch’in had traditionally been seen as a violent dictator
whose reign was short; the brilliance of Mao’s strategy was to turn this
around, simultaneously reinterpreting Ch’in, justifying his rule in the eyes
of present-day Chinese, and using him to justify the violence of the new
order that Mao himself was creating.
After the failed Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, a power struggle
LAW 45

395

emerged in the Communist Party in which Mao’s main foe was Lin Piao,
once a close

tween his
cast

friend of his. To make clear to the masses the difference be-

philosophy and Lin’s, Mao once again exploited the past: He

his opponent as representing Confucius, a. philosopher Lin in fact

would constantly quote. And Confucius signified the conservatism of the

past. Mao associated himself, on the other hand, with the ancient philosophical movement known as Legalism, exemplified by the writings of
Han—fei~tzu. The Legalists disdained Confucian ethics; they believed in the
need for violence to create a new order. They worshiped power. To give

himself weight in the struggle, Mao unleashed a nationwide propaganda

campaign against Confucius, using the issues of Confucianism versus Legalism to whip the young into a kind of frenzied revolt against the older
generation. This grand context enveloped a. rather banal power struggle,
and Mao once again won over the masses and triumphed over his enemies.

Interpretation
No people had a more profound attachment to the past than the Chinese.
In the face of this enormous obstacle to reform, Mada strategy was simple:
Instead of struggling against the past he turned it to his advantage, associ~
ating his radical Communists with the romantic figures of Chinese history.
Weaving the story of the War of the Three Kingdoms into the struggle between the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, be cast himself as

Chuko Liang. As the emperors had, he welcomed the cultlike adoration of
the masses, understanding that the Chinese could not function without
some kind of father

figure to admire. And after he made a terrible blunder

with the Great Leap Forward, trying to force modernization on the country
and failing miserably, he never repeated his mistake: From then on, radical

change had to be cloaked in the comfortable clothes of the past.
The lesson is simple: The past is powerful. What has happened before
seems
greater; habit and history give any act weight. Use this to your advantage. When you destroy the fa.milia.r you create a void or vacuum; peo
ple fear the chaos that will flood in to fill it. You must avoid stirring up such
fears at all cost. Borrow the weight and legitimacy from the past, however
remote, to create a comforting and familiar presence. This will give your
actions romantic associations, add to your presence, and cloak the nature

of the changes you are attempting.

ritated and upset by changes that affect them personally. They know that

change is necessary, and that novelty provides relief from boredom, but
deep inside they cling to the past. Change in the abstract, or superficial
change, they desire, but a change that upsets core habits and routines is
deeply disturbing to them.
No revolution has gone without a powerful later reaction against it, for
in the long run the void it creates proves too unsettling to the human animal, who unconsciously associates such voids with death and chaos. The
opportunity for change and renewal seduces people to the side of the revo~
lution, but once their enthusiasm fades, which it will, they are left with a
certain emptiness. Yearning for the past, they create an opening for it to
creep back in.
For Machiavelli, the prophet who preaches and brings change can

only survive by taking up arms: When the masses inevitably yearn for the
past, he must be ready to use force. But the armed prophet. cannot last long
unless he quickly creates a new set of values and rituals to replace the old
ones, and to soothe the anxieties of those who dread change. It is far easier,
and less bloody, to play a kind of con game. Preach change as much as you
like, and even enact your reforms, but give them the comforting appearance of

older events and traditions.

Reigning from A.D. 8 to AD. 23, the Chinese emperor Wang Mung
emerged from a period of great historical turbulence in which the people
yearned for order, an order represented for them by Confucius. Some two
hundred years earlier, however, Emperor Ch’in had ordered the writings
of Confucius burned. A few years later, word had spread that certain texts
had miraculously survived, hidden under the scholar’s house. These texts

may not have been genuine, but they gave Wang his opportunity: He first
confiscated them, then had his scribes insert passages into them that
seemed to support the changes he had been imposing on the country.
When he released the texts, it seemed that Confucius sanctioned Wang’s

reforms, and the people felt comforted and accepted them more easily.
Understand: The fact that the past is dead and buried gives you the
freedom to reinterpret it. To support your cause, tinker with the facts. The
past is a text in which you can safely insert your own lines.
A simple gesture like using an old title, or keeping the same number
for a group, will tie you to the past and support you with the authority of
history. As Machiavelli himself observed, the Romans used this device
when they transformed their monarchy into a republic. They may have in
stalled two consuls in place of the king, but since the king had been served

by twelve lictors, they retained the same number to serve under the consuls. The king had personally performed an annual sacrifice, in 9. great
spectacle that stirred the public; the republic retained this practice, only
transferring it to a special “chief of the ceremony, whom they called the
King of the sacrifice.” These and similar gestures satisfied the people and
kept them from clamoring for the monarchy’s return.
Another strategy to disguise change is to make a loud and public dis~
play of support for the values of the past. Seem to be a zealot for tradition

had a centuries—old republic, and was suspicious of anyone who
floated its traditions. Cosimo de’ Medici made a Show of enthusiastic sup

port for the republic, while in reality he worked to bring the city under the
control of his wealthy family. In form, the Medicis retained the appearance
of a republic; in substance, they rendered it powerless. They quietly en~

acted a radical change, while appearing to safeguard tradition.
Science claims a search for truth that would seem to protect it from
conservatism and the irrationality of habit: It is a culture of innovation. Yet

when Charles Darwin published his ideas of evolution, he faced fiercer ope

position from his fellow scientists than from religious authorities. His theories challenged too many fixed ideas. Jonas Salk ran into the same wall

with his radical innovations in immunology, as did Max Planck with his

revolutionizing of physics. Planck later wrote of the scientific opposition he
faced, “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents
and making them see the light. but rather because its opponents eventually
die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”
The answer to this innate conservatism is to play the courtier’s game.

let your theories do their radical work. Play with appearances and respect

past protocol. This is true in every arenae-science being no exception.

Finally, powerful people pay attention to the zeitgeist If their reform is
too far ahead of its time, few will understand it, and it will stir up anxiety

and be hopelessly misinterpreted. The changes you make must seem less
innovative than they are. England did eventually become a Protestant na~

tion, as Cromwell wished, but it took over a century of gradual evolution.
Watch the zeitgeist. If you work in a tumultuous time, there is power to
be gained by preaching a return to the past, to comfort, tradition, and rit-

ual. During a period of stagnation, on the other hand, play the card of reform and revo1ution—but beware of what you stir up. Those who finish a

revolution are rarely those who start it. You will not succeed at this dangerous game unless

Authority: He who desires or attempts to reform the government of a

change in the institutions, even though in fact they are entirely different
from the old ones. For the great majority of mankind are satisfied with appearances, as though they were realities. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

The past is a corpse to be used as you see fit. If what happened in the recent past was

in everyone’s minds. If the court that he established had borne any resem-

blance to the lavish court of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, his courtiers
would have spent all their time worrying about their own necks. Instead,

Napoleon established a court remarkable for its sobriety and lack of ostentation. It was the court of a man who valued work and military virtues. This
new form seemed

appropriate and reassuring.

In other words, pay attention to the times. But understand: If you

make a bold change from the past, you must avoid at all costs the appearance of a void or vacuum, or you will create terror. Even an

ugly recent his-

tory will seem preferable to an empty space. Fill that space immediately
with new rituals and forms. Soothing and growing familiar, these will secure
your position among the masses.
Finally, the arts, fashion, and technology would seem to be areas in

which power would come from creating a radical rupture with the past and

appearing cutting edge. Indeed, such a strategy can bring great power, but
it has many dangers. It is inevitable that your innovations will be outdone

by someone else. You have little control—-someone younger and fresher
moves in a sudden new direction, making your bold innovation of yester~
day seem tiresome and tame today. You are forever playing catch-up; your
power is tenuous and short-lived. You want a power built on something
more solid. Using the past, tinkering with tradition, playing with convention to subvert it will give your creations something more than a momentary appeal. Periods of dizzying change disguise the fact that a yearning for
the past will inevitably creep back in. In the end, using the past for your
own
purposes will bring you more power than trying to cut it out comp1etely—-a. futile and self-destructive endeavor.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW

Joe Orton met Kenneth Halliwell at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts,
London, in 1953, where both had enrolled as acting students. They soon
became lovers and moved in together. Halliwell, twenty—five at the time,
was seven years

older than Orton, and seemed the more confident of the

two; but neither had much talent as actors, and after graduating, having set~
tied down together in a dank London apartment, they decided to give up

acting and collaborate as writers instead. Halliwell’s inheritance was
enough to keep them from having to find work for a few years, and in the
beginning, he was also the driving force behind the stories and novels they
wrote; he would dictate to Orton, who would type the manuscripts, occa~
sionally interjecting his own lines and ideas. Their first efforts attracted
some interest from literary agents, but it sputtered. The promise they had
shown was leading nowhere.
Eventually the inheritance money ran out, and the pair had to look for
work. Their collaborations were less enthusiastic and less frequent. The fu~
ture looked bleak.

In 1957 Orton began to write on his own, but it wasn’t until five years

later, when the lovers were jailed for six months for defacing dozens of library books, that he began to find his voice (perhaps not by chance: This
was the first time he

Loot, and his popularity soared. Soon commissions came in from all sides,
including from the Beatles, who paid Orton handsomely to write them a

Everything was pointing upwards, everything except Orton’s relation»

grew successful, Halliwell began to deteriorate. Watching his lover become
the center of attention, he suffered the humiliation of becoming a kind of
personal assistant to the playwright, his role in what had once been a collaboration growing smaller and smaller. In the l950s he had supported
Orton with his inheritance; now Orton supported him. At a party or
among friends, people would naturally gravitate towards Orton-—he was
charming, and his mood was almost always buoyant Unlike the handsome
Orton, Halliwell was bald and awkward; his defensiveness made people
want to avoid him.

With Orton’s success the couple‘s problems only worsened. Halliwell’s
moods made their life together impossible. Orton claimed to want to leave

him, and had numerous affairs, but would always end up returning to his

Interpretation
Kenneth Halliwell had tried to cast his deterioration as mental illness, but
what joe Orton’s diaries revealed to him was the truth: It was envy, pure

and simple, that lay at the heart of his sickness. The diaries, which Halliwell read on the sly, recounted the couple’s days as equals and their strug-

gle for recognition. After Orton found success, the diaries began to
describe Halliwell’s brooding, his rude comments at parties, his growing
sense of
inferiority. All of this Orton narrated with a distance that bordered
on

contempt.
The diaries made clear Halliwe1l’s bitterness over Orton’s success.

Eventually the only thing that would have satisfied him would have been
for Orton to have a failure of his own, an unsuccessful play perhaps, so that
they could have commiserated in their failure, as they had done years be
fore. When the opposite happened—as Orton grew only more successful
and popular—Halliwell did the only thing that would make them equals
again: He made them equals in death. With Orton’s murder, he became almost as famous as his friend——posthumously.
Joe Orton only partly understood his l0ver’s deterioration. His attempt
to help Halliwell launch a career in art registered for what it was: charity
and guilt Orton basically had two possible solutions to the problem. He
could have downplayed his own success, displaying some faults, deflecting
I-Ialliwell’s envy; or, once he realized the nature of the problem, he could
have fled as if Halliwell were a viper, as in fact he was—a viper of envy.

and day by day it festers inside him. Eventually he will attack.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
The merchant class and the craft guilds to which medieval Florence owed
its prosperity had created a republic that protected them from oppression

by the nobility. Since high office could only be held for a few months, no
one could gain lasting dominance, and although this meant that the politi
cal factions struggled constantly for control, the system kept out tyrants
and petty dictators. The Medici family lived for several centuries under this
system without making much of a mark. They had modest origins as
apothecaries, and were typical middle-class citizens. Not until the late fourteenth century, when Giovanni de’ Medici made a modest fortune in bank

ing, did they emerge as a force to be reckoned with.
Upon Giova.nni’s death, his son Cosimo took over the family business,
and quickly demonstrated his talent for it. The business prospered under
his control and the Medicis emerged as one of the preeminent banking

families of Europe. But they had a rival in Florence: Despite the city’s re—

puhlican system, one family, the Albizzis, had managed over the years to
monopolize control of the government, forging alliances that allowed them
to constantly fill important offices with their own men. Cosimo did not
light this, and in fact gave the Albizzis his tacit support. At the same time,
while the Albizzis were beginning to flaunt their power, Cosimo made a
point of staying in the background.
Eventually, however, the Medici wealth could not be ignored, and in
1433, feeling threatened by the family, the Albizzis used their government
muscle to have Cosimo arrested on charges of conspiring to overthrow the
republic. Some in the Alhizzi faction wanted Cosimo executed, others
feared this would spark a civil war. In the end they exiled him from Florence. Cosimo did not
fight the sentence; he left quietly. Sometimes, he
knew, it is wiser to bide one’s time and keep a low profile.
Over the next year, the Alhizzis began to stir up fears that they were
setting up a dictatorship. Meanwhile, Cosimo, using his wealth to advantage, continued to exert influence on Florentine affairs, even from exile. A
civil war broke out in the city, and in September of 1434 the Albizzis were

the sidelines, on the other hand, he would leave an opening for another
faction to rise up as the Albizzis had, and to punish the Medicis for their
success.

Cosimo solved the problem in two ways: He secretly used his wealth
buy influence among key citizens, and he placed his own allies, all cleverly enlisted from the middle classes to disguise their allegiance to him, in
top government positions. Those who complained of his growing political
clout were taxed into submission, or their properties were bought out from
under them by Cosimo’s banker allies. The republic survived in name
only. Cosimo held the strings.
While he worked behind the scenes to gain control, however, publicly
Cosimo presented another picture. When he walked through the streets of
Florence, he dressed modestly, was attended by no more than one servant, and bowed deferentially to magistrates and elder citizens. He rode a
mule instead of a horse. He never spoke out on matters of public import,
even though he controlled Florence’s foreign affairs for over thirty years.
to

He gave money to charities and maintained his ties to Florence’s merchant
class. He financed all ldnds of public buildings that fed the Florentines’

pride in their city. When he built a palace for himself and his family in
nearby Fiesole, he turned down the ornate designs that Brunelleschi
had drawn up for him and instead chose a modest structure designed by
Michelozzo, a man of humble Florentine origins. The palace was a symbol
of Cosimo’s strategy—all simplicity on the outside, all elegance and opu~
lence within.
Cosimo finally died in 1464, after ruling for

years. The citizens

of Florence wanted to build him a great tomb, and to celebrate his memory

with elaborate funeral ceremonies, but on his deathbed he had asked to be

buried without

“any pomp or demonstration.” Some sixty years later,
Machiavelli hailed Cosimo as the wisest of all princes, “for he knew how

extraordinary things that are seen and appear every hour make men much
more envied than

those that are done in deed and are covered over with

decency.”
Interpretation
A close friend of Cosimo’s, the bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci, once
wrote of him, “And whenever he wished to achieve

something, he saw to it,

in order to escape envy as much as possible, that the initiative appeared to
come

from others, and not from h.1'.m.” One of Cosirno’s favorite expres-

sions was, “Envy is a weed that should not be watered.” Understanding the

power envy has in a democratic environment, Cosimo avoided the appearance of greatness. This does not mean that greatness should be suffocated,

only the mediocre should survive; only that a game of appearances
must be played. The insidious envy of the masses can actually be deflected
quite easily: Appear as one of them in style and values. Make alliances with
those below you, and elevate them to positions of power to secure their
support in times of need. Never flaunt your wealth, and carefully conceal

the degree to which it has bought influence. Make a display of deferring to

others, as if they were more powerful than you. Cosimo de’ Medici perfected this game; he was a consummate con artist of appearances. No one

could gauge the extent of his power———his modest exterior hid the truth.
Never be so foolish as to believe that you are stirring up admiration by

flaunting the qualities that raise you above others. By making others aware
of their inferior position, you are only stirring up “unhappy admiration,” or
envy, which will gnaw away at them until they undermine you in ways you
cannot foresee. The fool dares the gods of envy by flaunting his victories.

There are several strategies for dealing with the insidious, destructive
emotion of envy. First, accept the fact that there will be people who will

surpass you in some way, and also the fact that you may envy them. But
make that feeling a way of pushing yourself to equal or surpass them some-

day. let envy turn inward and it poisons the soul; expel it outward and it
can move
you to greater heights.
Second, understand that as you gain power, those below you will feel
envious of you. They may not show it but it is inevitable. Do not naively ac-

cept the facade they show you———read between the lines of their criticisms,
their little sarcastic remarks, the signs of backstabbing, the excessive praise
that is preparing you for a fall, the resentful look in the eye. Half the problem with envy comes when we do not recognize it until it is too late.

Finally, expect that when people envy you they will work against you

this kind of attack. And by the time you realize that envy is at the root of a
person’s feelings about you, it is often too late: Your excuses, your false humility, your defensive actions, only exacerbate the problem. Since it is far
easier to avoid creating envy in the first place than to get rid of it once it is
there, you should strategize to forestall it before it grows. It is often your
actions that stir up envy, your own unawareness. By becoming conscious of those actions and qualities that create envy, you can take the teeth

ers, however, who stir up envy in more subtle and unconscious ways, and

partly to blame for their troubles. Envy is often a problem, for example, for people with great natural talent.
Sir Walter Raleigh was one of the most brilliant men at the court of
Queen Elizabeth of England. He had skills as a scientist, wrote poetry still
recognized as among the most beautiful writing of the time, was a proven
are

leader of men, an enterprising entrepreneur, a great sea captain, and on

top of all this was a handsome, dashing courtier who charmed his way into
becoming one of the queen’s favorites. Wherever he went however, pea
ple blocked his path. Eventually he suffered a terrific fall from grace, leading even to prison and finally the executioner’s axe.
Raleigh could not understand the stubborn opposition he faced from
the other courtiers. He did not see that he had not only made no attempt to
disguise the degree of his skills and qualifies, he had imposed them on one
and all, making a show of his versatility, thinking it impressed people and
won him friends. In fact it made him silent enemies,
people who felt inferior to him and did all they could to ruin him the moment he tripped up or
made the slightest mistake. In the end, the reason he was executed was
ueason, but envy will use any cover it finds to mask its destructiveness.
The envy elicited by Sir Walter Raleigh is the worst kind: It was in-

spired by his natural talent and grace, which he felt was best displayed in
its full flower. Money others can attain; power as well. But superior intelligence, good looks, cha.rm—these are qualities no one can acquire. The naturally perfect have to work the most to disguise their brilliance, displaying
a

defect or two to deflect envy before it takes root. It is a common and

naive mistake to think you are charming people with your natural talents

when in fact they are coming to hate you.

unexpected promotion, a victory or success that seems to come

When Archbishop de Retz was promoted to the rank of cardinal, in
1651, he knew full well that many of his former colleagues envied him.

Understanding the foolishness of alienating those below him, de Retz did
everything he could to downplay his merit and emphasize the role of luck
in his success. To put people at ease, he acted humbly and deferentially, as if
nothing had changed. (In reality, of course, he now had much more power
than before.) He wrote that these wise policies “produced a good effect, by
lessening the envy which was conceived against me, which is the greatest of
all secrets.” Follow de Retz’s example. Subtly emphasize how lucky you
have been, to make your happiness seem more attainable to other people,
and the need for envy less acute. But be careful not to affect a false modesty
that people can easily see through. This will only make them more envious.
The act has to be good; your humility, and your openness to those you have
left behind, have to seem genuine. Any hint of insincerity will only make
your new status more oppressive. Remember: Despite your elevated posi»
tion, it will do you no good to alienate your former peers. Power requires a
wide and solid support base, which envy can silently destroy.

ington used the same strategy to great effect, first in refusing to keep the position of Commander in Chief of the American army, second in resisting
the presidency. In both cases he made himself more popular than ever.
People cannot envy the power that they themselves have given a person
who does not seem to desire it.

According to the Elizabethan statesman and writer Sir Francis Bacon,
the wisest policy of the powerful is to create a kind of pity for themselves,
as if their responsibilities were a burden and a sacrifice. How can one envy
a man who has taken on a
heavy load for the public interest? Disguise your
power as a. kind of self—sacrifice rather than a source of happiness and you
make it seem less enviable. Emphasize your troubles and you turn a potential danger (envy) into a source of moral support (pity). A similar ploy is to
hint that your good fortune will benefit those around you. To do this you
may need to open your purse strings, like Cimon, a wealthy general in ancient Athens who gave lavishly in all kinds of ways to prevent people from
resenting the influence he had bought in Athenian politics. He paid a high
price to cleflect their envy, but in the end it saved him from ostracism and
banishment from the city.
The painter J. M. W. Turner devised another way of giving to deflect

the envy of his fellow artists, which he recognized as his greatest obstacle to
his success. Noticing that his incomparable color skills made them afraid to

hang their paintings next to his in exhibitions, he realized that their fear
would turn to envy, and would eventually make it harder for him to find
galleries to show in. On occasion, then, Turner is known to have temporarily dampened the colors in his paintings with soot to earn him the goodwill
of his colleagues.

To deflect envy, Graciein recommends that the powerful display a

weakness, at minor social indiscretion, a harmless vice. Give those who
envy you something to feed on, distracting them from your more important sins. Remember: It is the reality that matters. You may have to

play

games with appearances, but in the end you will have what counts: true
power. In some Arab countries, a man will avoid arousing envy by doing
as Cosimo

de Medici did by showing his wealth only on the inside of his

house. Apply this wisdom to your own character.
Beware of some of envy’s disguises. Excessive praise is an almost sure

sign that the person praising you envies you; they are either setting you up
for a. fall—-it will be impossible for you to live up to their prajse——or they

sharpening their blades behind your back. At the same time, those who
hypercrifical of you, or who slander you publicly, probably envy you
as well. Recognize their behavior as
disguised envy and you keep out of
the trap of mutual mud-slinging, or of taking their criticisms to heart. Win
your revenge by ignoring their measly presence.
Do not try to help or do favors for those who envy you; they will think
you are condescending to them. joe Orton’s attempt to help Halliwell find
a
gallery for his work only intensified his lover‘s feelings of inferiority and
envy. Once envy reveals itself for what it is, the only solution is often to
flee the presence of the enviers, leaving them to stew in a hell of their own

Finally, be aware that some emrimnments are more conducive to envy
than others. The effects of envy are more serious among colleagues and
peers, where there is a veneer of equality. Envy is also destructive in demo~
cratic environments where overt displays of power are looked down upon.
Be extrasensitive in such environments. The filmmaker Ingmar Bergman
was hounded

by Swedish tax authorities because he stood out in a county

where standing out from the crowd is frowned on. It is almost impossible
to avoid envy in such cases, and there is little you can do but accept it gm»

ciously and take none of it personally. As Thoreau once said, “Envy is the

Authority: Upon occasion, reveal a harmless defect in your character. For the envious accuse the most perfect of sinning by having no
sins. They become an Argus, all eyes for finding fault with excellence—it is their only consolation. Do not let envy burst with its own
venom—affect some lapse in valor or intellect, so as to disarm it
beforehand. You thus wave your red cape before the Horns of Envy,
in order to save your immortality. (Baltasar Gracién, 1601-1658)

That is why you must act before envy takes root.
Once envy is there, however, whether through your fault or not, it is

every new triumph an opportunity to make the envious squirm.

This is how Michelangelo triumphed over the venomous architect

Bramante, who turned Pope Julius against Michela.ngelo’s design for his
tomb. Bramante envied Michelangelo’s godlike skills, and to this one tri-

umph—the aborted tomb project—he thought to add another, by pushing
the pope to commission Michelangelo to paint the murals in the Sistine

Chapel. The project would take years, during which Michelangelo would
accomplish no more of his brilliant sculptures. Furthermore, Bramante
considered Michelangelo not nearly as skilled in painting as in sculpture.
The chapel would spoil his image as the perfect artist.
Michelangelo saw the trap and wanted to turn down the commission,
but he could not refuse the pope, so he accepted it without complaint.
Then, however, he used Bra.rnante’s envy to spur him to greater heights,
making the Sistine Chapel his most perfect work of all. Every time Bramante heard of it or saw it, he felt more oppressed by his own envy—the
sweetest and most lasting revenge you can exact on the envious.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In 559 B.C., a young man named Cyrus gathered an immense army from

the scattered tribes of Persia and marched against his grandfather Astyages,

king of the Medes. He defeated Astyages with ease, had himself crowned
king of Medea and Persia, and began to forge the Persian Empire. Victory
followed victory in quick succession. Cyrus defeated Croesus, ruler of
Lydia, then conquered the Ionian islands and other smaller kingdoms; he
marched on Babylon and crushed it. Now he was known as Cyrus the
Great, King of the World.
After capturing the riches of Babylon, Cyrus set his sights on the east,
on the half-barbaric tribes of the Massagetai, a. vast realm on the Caspian
Sea. A fierce warrior race led by Queen Tomyris, the Massagetai lacked the
riches of Babylon, but Cyrus decided to attack them anyway, believing
himself superhuman and incapable of defeat. The Massagetai would fall
easily to his vast armies, making his empire immense.
In 529 B.C., then, Cyrus marched to the wide river Araxes, gateway to
the kingdom of the Massagetai. As he set up camp on the western bank, he
received a message from Queen Tomyris: “King of the Medes,” she told
him, “I advise you to abandon this enterprise, for you cannot know if in the
end it will do you any good. Rule your own people, and try to bear the

sight of me ruling mine. But of course you will refuse my advice, as the last
thing you wish for is to live in peace.” Tomyris, confident of her army’s
strength and not wishing to delay the inevitable battle, offered to withdraw
the troops on her side of the river, allowing Cyrus to cross its waters safely
and fight her army on the eastern side, if that was his desire.
Cyrus agreed, but instead of engaging the enemy directly he decided
to play a trick. The Massagetai knew few luxuries. Once Cyrus had crossed

the river and made his camp on the eastern side, he set the table for an
elaborate banquet, full of meat, delicacies, and strong wine. Then he left
his weakest troops in the camp and withdrew the rest of the army to the
river. A large Massagetai detachment soon attacked the camp and killed all

of the Persian soldiers in a fierce battle. Then, overwhelmed by the fabu—

Qieen Tomyris.

When the queen learned what had happened, she sent a message to
Cyrus, chiding him for using tricks to defeat her army. “Now listen to me,”
she wrote, “and I will advise you for your own good: Give me back my son

and leave my country with your forces intact, and be content with your tri-

whelmed Tomyris. She gathered all the forces that she could muster in her

kingdom, and whipping them into a vengeful frenzy, engaged Qrms’s
troops in a violent and bloody battle. Finally, the Massagetai prevailed. In
their anger they decimated the Persian army, killing Cyrus himself.
After the battle, Tomyris and her soldiers searched the battlefield for
Cyrus’s corpse. When she found it she cut olf his head and shoved it into a
wineskin full of human blood, crying out, “Though I have conquered you
and live, yet you have ruined me by treacherously taking my son. See
now--I fulfill my threat: You have your fill of blood.” After Cyrus’s death,
the Persian Empire quickly unraveled. One act of arrogance undid all of
Cyrus’s good work.

Cyrus ignored the lesson of Assyria. He paid no heed to the warnings
of oracles and advisers. He did not worry about offending a queen. His
many victories had gone to his head, clouding his reason. Instead of consolidating his already vast empire, he pushed forward. Instead of recognizing each situation as different, he thought each new war would bring the
same result as the one before as long as he used the methods he knew:
dred years earlier, the powerful Assyrian Empire had been

ruthless force and cunning.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
No single person in history has occupied a more delicate and precarious

position than the kings mistress. She had no real or legitimate power base
to fall back on in times of trouble‘, she was surrounded by packs of envious
courtiers eagerly anticipating her fall from grace; and finally, since the
source

of her power was usually her physical beauty, for most royal mis-

unpleasant.

King Louis XV of France began to keep official mistresses in the early
days of his reign, each woman’s good fortune rarely lasting more than a
few years. But then came Madame de Pompadour, who, when she was a
middle-class child of nine named jeanne Poisson, had been told by a fortune~teller that she would someday be the king’s favorite. This seemed an
absurd dream, since the royal mistress almost always came from the aris~
tocracy. Jeanne nevertheless believed herself destined to seduce the king,
and doing so became her obsession. She applied herselfto the talents the
king’s favorite had to have-—-music, dancing, acting, horseback riding——and she excelled in every one of them. As a young woman, she married a
of the lower nobility, which gave her an entree to the best salons in
Paris. Word quickly spread of her beauty, talent, charm, and intelligence.

riding, coquetry. The king finally succumbed to her charms, and in a ceremony at Versailles in September of 1745, this twenty—four—year~old daughter of a rniddleaclass banking agent was officially inaugurated as the king’s
mistress. She was given her own room in the palace, a room the king could

In 1751, when Madame de Pompadour was at the height of her power,
she experienced her worst crisis. Physically weakened by the responsibili—

Interpretation
Aware of the temporariness of her power, the kings mistress would often
go into a kind of frenzy after capturing the king: She would try to accumulate as much money as possible to protect her afler her inevitable fall. And
to extend her reign as long as possible, she would be ruthless with her enemies in the court. Her situation, in other words, seemed to demand from

her a greed and vindictiveness that would often be her undoing. Madame
de Pompadour succeeded where all others had failed because she never

pressed her good fortune. Instead of bullying the courtiers from her power»
ful position as the king’s mistress, she tried to win their support. She never
revealed the slightest hint of greed or arrogance. When she could no
longer perform her physical duties as mistress, she did not fret at the
thought of someone replacing her in bed. She simply applied some strategy--she encouraged the king to take young lovers, knowing that the
younger and prettier they were, the less of a threat they posed, since they
could not compare to her in charrn and sophistication and would soon
bore the monarch.

come to believe
your character is more responsible for your success than
your sirategizing and planning. Like Madame de Pompadour, you need to
realize that your moment of triumph is also a moment when you have to

rely on cunning and strategy all the more, consolidating your power base,
recognizing the role of luck and circumstance in your success, and remaining vigilant against changes in your good fortune. It is the moment of victory when you need to play the couttier's game and pay more attention

KEYS TO POWER
Power has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at the game
the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will, keeping peooff
balance while they set the tempo. The essence of strategy is controlple
are

ling what comes next, and the elation of victory can upset your ability to
control what comes next in two ways. First, you owe your success to a pat»

repeat. You will try to keep moving in the
stopping to see whether this is still the direction that
is best for you. Second, success tends to go to your head and make you
emotional. Feeling invulnerable, you make aggressive moves that ultimately undo the victory you have gained.
The lesson is simple: The powerful vary their rhythms and patterns,
tern that you are apt to try to
same direction without

change course, adapt to circumstance, and learn to improvise. Rather than
letting their dancing feet impel them forward, they step back and look
where they are going. It is as if their bloodstream bore a kind of antidote to
the intoxication of victory, letting them control their emotions and come to
a kind of mental halt when
they have attained success. They steady themselves, give themselves the space to reflect on what has happened, examine
the role of circumstance and luck in their success. As they say in riding

school, you have to be able to control yourself before you can control the
horse.
Luck and circumstance always play a. role in power. This is inevitable,
and actually makes the game more interesting. But despite what you may

think, good luck is more dangerous than had luck. Bad luck teaches valu~
able lessons about patience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the
worst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lesson, making you think
your brillliance will cany you through. Your fortune will inevitably turn,
and when it does you will be completely unprepared.

According to Machiavelli, this is what undid Cesare Borgia. He had
many triumphs, was actually a clever strategist, but had the bad luck to
have good luck: He had a. pope for a father. Then, when he had bad luck
for real—his fathefs death—-he was unprepared for it, and the many ene~

LAW 47

-I15

mies he had made devoured him. The good luck that elevates you or seals

your success brings the moment for you to open your eyes: The wheel of
fortune will hurtle you down as easily as up. If you prepare for the fall, it is
less likely to ruin you when it happens.

People who have a run of success can catch a kind of fever, and even
when they themselves try to stay calm, the people below them often pres—
sure

them to go past their mark and into dangerous waters. You have to

have a strategy for dealing with these people. Simply preaching moderar
tion will make you look weak and small-minded; seeming to fail to follow

up on a victory can lessen your power.
When the Athenian general and statesman Pericles led a series of
naval campaigns around the Black Sea in 436 u.(:., his easy triumphs enflamed the Athenians’ desire for

more.

They dreamed of conquering

Egypt, overrunning Persia, sailing for Sicily. On the one hand Pericles
reined in these dangerous emotions by warning of the perils of hubris. On
the other hand he fed them by fighting small battles that he knew he could

win, creating the appearance that he was preserving the momentum of suc»
cess.

The skill with which Pericles played this game is revealed by what

happened when he died: The demagogues Cook over, pushed Athens into
invading Sicily, and in one rash move destroyed an empire.
The rhythm of power often requires an alternation of force and cunning. Too much force creates a counterreaction; too much cunning, no
matter how cunning it is, becomes

predictable. Working on behalf of his

master, the shogun Oda Nobunaga, the great sixteenth-century japanese
general (and future emperor) Hideyoshi once engineered a stunning vic-

tory over the army of the formidable General Yoshimoto. The shogun
wanted to go further, to take on and crush yet another powerful enemy, but

Hideyoshi reminded him of the old Japanese saying: “When you have
won a victory, tighten the strings of your helmet.” For Hideyoshi this was
the moment for the shogun to switch from force to cunning and indirection, setting his enemies against one another through a. series of deceptive
alliances. In this way he would avoid stirring up needless opposition by
appearing overly aggressive. When you are victorious, then, lie low, and
lull the enemy into inaction. These changes of rhythm are immensely
powerful.
People who go past the mark are often motivated by a desire to please
a master
by proving their dedication. But an excess of effort exposes you to
the risk of making the master suspicious of you. On several occasions, generals under Philip of Macedon were disgraced and demoted immediately
after leading their troops to a great victory; one more such victory, Philip
thought, and the man might become a rival instead of an underling. When
you serve a master, it is often wise to measure your victories carefully, letting him get the glory and never making him uneasy. It is also wise to establish a pattern of strict obedience to earn his trust. In the fourth century
B.C., a. captain under the notoriously severe Chinese general Wu Ch’i
charged ahead before a battle had begun and came back with several

416

LAW 47

enemy heads. He thought he had shown his fiery enthusiasm, but Wu Ch’i
was
unimpressed. “A talented officer,” the general said with a sigh as he ordered the man beheaded, “but a disobedient one.”
Another moment when 3. small success can spoil the chances for a

larger one may come if a master or superior grants you a favor: It is a dangerous mistake to ask for more. You will seem insecur%perhaps you feel
you did not deserve this favor, and have to grab as much as you can when
you have the chance, which may not come again. The proper response is
to accept the favor graciously and withdraw. Any subsequent favors you
should earn without having to ask for them.

Finally, the moment when you stop has great dramatic import. What
comes last sticks in the mind as a kind of exclamation

point. There is no

better time to stop and walk away than after a victory. Keep going and you
risk lessening the effect, even ending up defeated. As lawyers say of cross-

examination, “Always stop with a victory.”

Authority: Princes and republics should content themselves with victory,
for when they aim at more, they generally lose. The use of insulting language toward an enemy arises from the insolence of victory, or from the
false hope of victory, which latter misleads men as often in their actions
as in

their words; for when this false hope takes possession of the mind,

it makes men go beyond the mark, and causes them to sacrifice a. certain good for an uncertain better.

REVE R SAL

As Machiavelli says, either destroy a man or leave him alone entirely. In-

flicting half punishment or mild injury will only create an enemy whose
bitterness will grow with time, and who will take revenge. When you beat
an

enemy, then, make your victory complete. Crush him into nonexis

tence. In the moment of victory, you do not restrain yourself from

crushing

the enemy you have defeated, but rather from needlessly advancing
against others. Be merciless with your enemy, but do not create new enemies by overreaching.

There are some who become more cautious than ever after a victory,
which they see as just giving them more possessions to wony about and

protect. Your caution after victory should never make you hesitate, or lose
momentum, but rather act as a safeguard against rash action. On the other
hand, momentum as a phenomenon is greatly overrated. You create your
own successes, and if they follow one upon the other, it is your own doing.
Belief in momentum will only make you emotional, less prone to act strate»

gically, and more apt to repeat the same methods. Leave momentum for
those who have nothing better to rely upon.

By the eighth century B.C., the city-states of Greece had grown so large and
prosperous that they had run out of land to support their expanding populations. So they turned to the sea, establishing colonies in Asia Minor,
Sicily, the Italian peninsula, even Africa. The city-state of Sparta, however,
was landlocked and surrounded
by mountains. Lacking access to the
Mediterranean, the Spartans never became a seafaring people; instead
they turned on the cities around them, and, in a series of brutal, violent
conflicts lasting more than a hundred years, managed to conquer an immense area that would
provide enough land for their citizens. This solution
to their problem, however,
brought a new, more formidable one: How
could they maintain and police their conquered territories? The subordinate peoples they ruled now outmimbered them ten to one. Surely this
horde would take a horrible revenge on them.

Sparta’s solution was to create a society dedicated to the art of war.
Spartans would be tougher, stronger, and fiercer than their neighbors. This
was the
only way they could ensure their stability and survival.
When a Spartan boy reached the age of seven, he was taken from his
mother and placed in a military club where he was trained to fight and underwent the strictest discipline. The boys slept on beds of reeds; they were
allotted only one outer garment to wear for an entire year. They studied
none of the arts; indeed, the
Spartans banned music, and permitted only
slaves to practice the crafts that were necessary to sustain them. The only
skills the Spartans taught were those of warfare. Children seen as weaklings
were

ing

left to die in a cavern in the mountains. No system of money or trad-

was allowed in

Sparta; acquired wealth, they believed, would sow self-

ishness and dissension, weakening their warrior discipline. The only way a

The Spartans’ single-mindedness allowed them to forge the most powerful infantry in the world. They marched in perfect order and fought with

incomparable bravery. Their tighbknit phalamxes could vanquish an army
ten times their size, as they proved in defeating the Persians at Thermopylae. A Spartan column on the march would strike terror in the enemy; it
seemed to have no weaknesses. Yet although the Spartans proved them~
selves mighty warriors, they had no interest in creating an empire. They
only wanted to keep what they had already conquered and to defend it
against invaders. Decades would pass without a single change in the system
that had succeeded so well in preserving Spa.rta’s status quo.
At the same time that the Spartans were evolving their warlike culture,
another city—state was rising to equal prominence: Athens, Unlike Sparta,
Athens had taken to the sea, not so much to create colonies as for purposes
of trade. The Athenians became great merchants; their currency, the fa“owl coins,” spread throughout the Mediterranean. Unlike the rigid

Spartans.
In 4-31 B.C., the war that had been brewing between Athens and Sparta

for so long finally erupted. It lasted twenty—seven years, but after many
twists of fortune, the Spartan war machine finally emerged victorious. The

Spartans

now

commanded an empire. and this time they could not stay in

their shell. If they gave up what they had gained, the beaten Athenians

would regroup and rise against them, and the long war would have been

fought for naught.
After the war, Athenian money poured into Sparta. The Spartans had

been trained in warfare, not politics or economics; because they were so
unaccustomed to it, wealth and its accompanying ways of life seduced and
overwhelmed them. Spartan governors were sent to rule what had been

Athenian lands; far from home, they succumbed to the worst forms of cor-

ruption. Sparta had defeated Athens, but the fluid Athenian way of life was

slowly breaking down its discipline and loosening its rigid order. And
Athens, meanwhile, was adapting to losing its empire, managing to thrive
as a cultural

and economic center.

Confused by a change in its status quo, Sparta grew weaker and
weaker. Some thirty years after defeating Athens, it lost an important battle
with the city-state of Thebes. Almost overnight, this once mighty nation

collapsed, never to recover.
Interpretation
In the evolution of species, protective armor has almost always spelled dis-

Although there are a few exceptions, the shell most often becomes a
dead end for the animal encased in it; it slows the creature down, making it
hard for it to forage for food and making it a target for fast~moving predators. Animals that take to the sea or sky, and that move swiftly and unpre
djctably, are infinitely more powerful and secure.
In facing a serious problem~——controlling superior numbers—Sparta
reacted like an animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the environment. But like a turtle, the Spartans sacrificed mobility for safety. They
managed to preserve stability for three hundred years, but at what cost?
They had no culture beyond warfare, no arts to relieve the tension, a con
stant anxiety about the status quo. While their neighbors took to the sea,
learning to adapt to a world of constant motion, the Spartans entombed
themselves in their own system. Victory would mean new lands to govern,
which they did not want; defeat would mean the end of their military ma
chine, which they did not want, either. Only stasis allowed them to survive.
But nothing in the world can remain stable forever, and the shell or system
you evolve for your protection will someday prove your undoing.
In the case of Sparta, it was not the armies of Athens that defeated it,
but the Athenian money. Money flows everywhere it has the opportunity
to go; it cannot be controlled, or made to fit a prescribed pattern. It is inherently chaotic. And in the long run, money made Athens the conqueror,

by infiltrating the Spartan system and corroding its protective armor. In the
battle between the two systems, Athens was fluid and creative enough to
take new forms, while Sparta could grow only more rigid until it cracked.
This is the way the world works, whether for animals, cultures, or individuals. In the face of the world’s harshness and danger, organisms of any

kind develop protection-—a coat of armor, a rigid system, a comforting ritual. For the short term it may work, but for the long term it spells disaster.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
When World V\7ar II ended and the Japanese, who had invaded China

1937, had finally been thrown out, the Chinese Nationalists, lead by
Chiang Kai-shek, decided the time had come to annihilate the Chinese
Communists, their hated rivals, once and for all. They had almost succeeded in 1935, forcing the Communists into the Long March, the grueling
in

retreat that had

greatly diminished their numbers. Although the Commu«

nists had recovered somewhat during the war against japan, it would not

be difficult to defeat them now. They controlled only isolated areas in the

countryside, had unsophisticated weaponry, lacked any military experience or training
beyond mountain fighting, and controlled no important
parts of China, except areas of Manchutia, which they had managed to take
after the Japanese retreat. Chiang decided to commit his best forces in
Manclmria. He would take over its major cities and from those bases would
spread through this northern industrial region, sweeping the Communists
away. Once Manchuria had fallen the Communists would collapse.
In 1945 and ’46 the plan worked perfectly: The Nationalists easily
took the major Manchurian cities. Puzzlingly, though, in the face of this
critical campaign, the Communist strategy made no sense. When the Nationalists began their push, the Communists dispersed to Manchuria’s most
out-of—the-way corners. Their small units harassed the Nationalist armies,
ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly there, but these dispersed
units never linked up, making them hard to attack. They would seize a

only to give it up a few weeks later. Forming neither rear guards I101’
vanguards, they moved like mercury, never staying in one place, elusive
town

and formless.

The Nationalists ascribed this to two things: cowardice in the face
of superior forces and inexperience in strategy. Mao Tse~tung, the Com»
munjst leader, was more a poet and philosopher than a general, whereas

Chiang had studied warfare in the West and was a follower of the German
military writer Carl Von Clausewitz, among others.
422

l

LAW 43

Yet a pattern did eventually emerge in Mao‘s attacks. After the Nationalists had taken the cities, leaving the Communists to occupy what was gen-

erally considered Ma.nchun‘a’s useless space, the Communists started using
that large space to surround the cities. If Chiang sent an army from one city
to

Interpretation
The two board games that best approximate the strategies of war are chess
and the Asian game of go. In chess the board is small. In comparison to go,
the attack comes relatively quickly, forcing a decisive battle. It rarely pays

Go is much less formal. It is played on a large grid, with 361 inter-

sections——nearly six times as many positions as in chess. Black and white
stones (one color for each side) are placed on the board’s intersections, one

you like. Once all your stories (52 for each side) are on

A game of go——called wet’-chi in China-can last up to three hundred
moves.

The strategy is more subtle and fluid than chess, developing slowly;

the more complex the pattern your stories initially create on the board, the

harder it is for your opponent to understand your strategy. Fighting to control a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have to think in larger
terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order eventually to dominate
the board. What you are after is not an entrenched position but mobility.

With mobility you can isolate the opponent in small areas and then encircle them. The aim is not to kill off the opponent’s pieces directly, as in

chess, but to induce a kind of paralysis and collapse. Chess is linear, position oriented, and aggressive; go is nonlinear and fluid. Aggression is indi-

an addict of

wei-chi, and its precepts were ingrained in his strategies. A key

wet‘-chi concept, for example, is to use the size of the board to your advan»

tage, spreading out in every direction so that your opponent cannot fathom
your movements in a simple linear way.
“Every Chinese,” Mao once wrote, “should consciously throw himself
into this war of a jigsaw pattern” against the Nationalists. Place your men in

ajigsaw pattern in go, and your opponent loses himself trying to figure out
what you are up to. Either he wastes time pursuing you or, like Chiang Kai‘
shek, he assumes you are incompetent and fails to protect himself. And if
he concentrates on single areas, as Western strategy advises, he becomes a
sitting duck for encirclement. In the weiwhi way of war, you encircle the
enemy’s brain, using mind games, propaganda, and irritation tactics to
confuse and dishearten. This was the strategy of the Communis(s—an apparent foxmlessness that disoriented and terrified their enemy.
Where chess is linear and direct, the ancient game of go is closer to the
kind of strategy that will prove relevant in a world where battles are fought

indirectly, in vast, loosely connected areas. Its strategies are abstract and
multidimensional, inhabiting a plane beyond time and space: the sl:ratc~
gist’s mind. In this fluid form of warfare, you value movement over position. Your speed and mobility make it impossible to predict your moves;
unable to understand you, your enemy can form no strategy to defeat you.

Instead of fixing on particular spots, this indirect form of warfare spreads
out, just as you can use the large and disconnected nature of the real world
to your advantage. Be like a vapor. Do not give your opponents anything
solid to attack; watch as they exhaust themselves pursuing you, trying to

cope with your elusiveness. Only formlessness allows you to truly surprise
your enemies—by the time they figure out where you are and what you are
up to, it is too late.

KEYS TO POWER
The human animal is

distinguished by its constant creation of forms.

Rarely expressing its emotions directly, it gives them form through language, or through socially acceptable rituals. We cannot communicate our
emotions without a form.
The forms that we create, however, change constandymin fashion, in

style, in all those human phenomena representing the mood of the moment. We are constantly altering the forms we have inherited from previgenerations, and these changes are signs of life and vitality. Indeed. the
things that don’t change, the forms that rigidify, come to look to us like
death, and we destroy them. The young show this most clearly: Uncomfortable with the forms that society imposes upon them, having no set identity, they play with their own characters, trying on a variety of masks and

poses to express themselves. This is the vitality that drives the motor of

form, creating constant changes in style.
The powerful are often people who in their youth have shown im~

creativity in expressing something new through a new form. Society

grants them power because it hungers for and rewards this sort of newness.

The powerful are constantly creating form, and their power comes from
the rapidity with which they can change. Their formlessness is in the eye of
the enemy who cannot see what they are up to and so has nothing solid to

ability to wreak havoc on Mount Olympus.
Human creations evolve toward abstraction, toward being more rnen~
tal and less material. This evolution is clear in art, which, in this century,

made the great discovery of abstraction and conceptualism; it can also be

politics, which over time have become less overtly violent, more
complicated, indirect and cerebral. Warfare and strategy too have followed
this pattern. Strategy began in the manipulation of armies on land, posi—
tioning them in ordered forrnations; on land, strategy is relatively two dimensional, and controlled by topography. But all the great powers have
eventually taken to the sea, for commerce and colonization. And to protect
their trading lanes they have had to learn how to fight at sea. Maritime warfare requires tremendous creativity and abstract thinking, since the lines
are constantly
shifting. Naval captains distinguish themselves by their abil»
ity to adapt to the literal fluidity of the terrain and to confuse the enemy
with an abstract, hard—to—ant:icipate form. They are operating in a third diseen in

mension: the mind.

Back on land, guerrilla warfare too demonstrates this evolution toward
abstraction. T. E. Lawrence was perhaps the first modern strategist to de-

LAW 48

425

velop the theory behind this kind of warfare, and to put it into practice. His
ideas influenced Mao, who found in his writings an uncanny Western
equivalent to wei-chi. Lawrence was working with Arabs fighting for their

territory against the Turks. His idea was to make the Arabs blend into the
vast desert, never providing a target, never collecting together in one place.
As the Turks scrambled to fight this vaporous army, they spread themselves thin, wasfing energy in moving from place to place. They had the superior firepower but the Arabs kept the inifiative by playing cat and
mouse, giving the Turks nothing to hold on to, destroying their morale.
“Most wars were wars of contact.
Ours should be a war of detachment,”
.

.

.

Lawrence wrote. “We were to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a
vast unknown desert, not

disclosing ourselves till we attacked.”

This is the ultimate form of strategy. The war of engagement has hecome

far too dangerous and costly; indirection and elusiveness yield far

better results at a much lower cost. The main cost, in fact, is mental-—the

thinking it takes to align your forces in scattered patiems, and to undermine the minds and psychology of your opponents. And nothing will infuriate and disoxient them more than formlessness. In a world where wars of

detachment are the order of the day, formlessness is crucial.

The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself

nothing personally. Never show any defensiveness. When you act
defensive, you show your emotions, revealing a clear form. Your opponents will realize they have hit a nerve, an Achilles’ heel. And they will hit
it again and again. So train yourself to take nothing personally. Never let
anyone get your back up. Be like a slippery ball that cannot be held: Let no
to take

one know what
a

gets to you, or where your weaknesses lie. Make your face

formless mask and you will infuriate and disorient your scheming col-

leagues and opponents.
One man who used this technique was Baron James Rothschild. A
German Jew in Paris, in a culture decidedly unfriendly to foreigners, Rothschild never took any attack on him personally or showed he had been
hurt in any way. He furthermore adapted himself to the political climate,
whatever it wa.s«——-the stiffly formal Restoration monarchy of Louis XVIII,

the bourgeois reign of Louis-Philippe, the democratic revolution of 1848,
the upstart Louis-Napoleon crowned emperor in 1852. Rothschild accepted them one and all, and blended in. He could afford to appear hypocritical or opportunistic because he was valued for his money, not his

politics; his money was the currency of power. While he adapted and
thrived, outwardly never showing a form, all the other great families that
had begun the century immensely wealthy were mined in the period’s
complicated shifts and turns of fortune. Attaching themselves to the past,
they revealed their embrace of a form.
Throughout history, the formless style of ruling has been most adeptly
practiced by the queen who reigns alone. A queen is in a radically diflerent
position from a. king; because she is a woman, her subjects and courtiers
are
likely to doubt her ability to rule, her strength of character. If she favors

one

side in some ideological struggle, she is said to be acting out of emo-

tional attachment. Yet if she represses her emotions and plays the authori-

tarian, in the male fashion, she arouses worse criticism still. Either by

by experience, then, queens tend to adopt a flexible style of govthat
in the end often proves more powerful than the more direct,
erning
nature or

male form.
Two female leaders exemplifying the forxnless style of rule are Queen
Elizabeth of England and Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. In the violent wars between Catholics and Protestants, Elizabeth steered a middle
course.

She avoided alliances that would commit her to one side, and that

over time

would harm the country. She managed to keep her country at

peace until it was strong enough for war. Her reign was one of the most glorious in history because of her incredible capacity to adapt and her flexible

ideology.
Catherine the Great too evolved an improvisatory style of governing.

Afler she deposed her husband, Emperor Peter H, taking sole control of
Russia in 1762, no one thought she would survive. But she had no precon»
ceived ideas, no philosophy or theory to dictate her policies. Although a

foreigner (she came from Germany), she understood Russia’s moods, and
how it was changing over the years. “One must govern in such a way that
one’s people think they themselves want to do what one commands them
to do,” she said, and to do this she had to be always a step ahead of their
desires and to adapt to their resistance. By never forcing the issue, she re«
formed Russia in a strikingly short period of time.
This feminine, fomiless style of ruling may have emerged as a way of
prospering under difficult circumstances, but it has proved immensely seductive to those who have served under it. Being fluid, it is relatively easy
for its subjects to obey, for they feel less coerced, less bent to their mler’s
ideology. It also opens up options where an adherence to a doctrine closes
them off. Without committing to one side, it allows the ruler to play one
enemy off another. Rigid rulers may seem strong, but with time their inflexibility wears on the nerves, and their subjects find ways to push them
from the stage. Fle>u'ble, formless rulers will be much criticized, but they
will endure, and people will eventually come to identify with them, since
they are as their subjects are--changing with the wind, open to circumstance.

Despite upsets and delays, the permeable style of power generally tri~
umphs in the end, just as Athens eventually won victory over Sparta
through its money and its culture. When you find yourself in conflict with
someone stronger and more rigid, allow them a momentary victory. Seem
to bow to their superiority. Then, by being formless and adaptable, slowly
insinuate yourself into their soul. This way you will catch them off guard,
for rigid people are always ready to ward of‘! direct blows but are helpless
against the subtle and insinuating. To succeed at such a strategy you must
play the cha.meleon—conform on the surface, while breaking down your
enemy from the inside.

For centuries the Japanese would accept foreigners graciously, and ap—
peared susceptible to foreign cultures and influences. joao Rodriguez, a
Portuguese priest who arrived in japan in 1577 and lived there for many
years, wrote, “I am flabbergasted by the Japanese willingness to my and accept everything Portuguese.” He saw japanese in the streets wearing Por—
tuguese clothing, with rosary beads at their necks and crosses at their hips.
This might seem like a weak, mutable culture, but ]apa.n’s adaptability
actually protected the country from having an alien culture imposed by
military invasion. It seduced the Portuguese and other Westerners into believing the japanese were yielding to a superior culture when actually the
foreign culture’s ways were merely a fashion to be donned and doffed.
Under the surface, Japanese culture thrived. Had the Japanese been rigid
about foreign influences and tried to fight them off, they might have suf-

fered the injuries that the West inflicted on China. That is the power of

i'ormlessness—~—it gives the aggressor nothing to react against, nothing to hit.
In evolution, largeness is often the first step toward extinction. What is
immense and bloated has no mobility, but must constantly feed itself. The

unintelligent are often seduced into believing that size connotes power, the
bigger the better.
In 4-83 13.0., King Xerxes of Persia invaded Greece, believing he could
conquer the country in one easy campaign. After all, he had the largest
army ever assembled for one invasion-—the historian Herodotus estimated
it at over more than five million. The Persians planned to build a bridge
across

the l-Iellespont to overrun Greece from the land, while their equally

immense navy would

pin the Greek ships in harbor, preventing their

forces from escaping to sea. The plan seemed sure, yet as Xerxes prepared
the invasion, his adviser Artabanus warned his master of grave misgivings:
“The two mightiest powers in the world are against you,” he said. Xerxes

laughed-—what powers could match his gigantic army? “I will tell you what
they are,” answered Artabanus. “The land and the sea." There were no safe
harbors large enough to receive Xerxes‘ fleet. And the more land the Persians conquered, and the longer their supply lines stretched, the more ruinous the cost of feeding this immense army would prove.
Thinking his adviser a coward, Xerxes proceeded with the invasion.
as
Yet
Artabanus predicted, bad weather at sea decimated the Persian fleet,
which was too large to take shelter in any harbor. On land, meanwhile, the
Persian army destroyed everything in its path, which only made it impossi—
hie to feed, since the destruction included crops and stores of food. it was

also an easy and slowqnoving target. The Greeks practiced all kinds of de

ceptive maneuvers to disorient the Persians. Xerxes’ eventual defeat at the
hands of the Greek allies was an immense disaster. The story is emblematic
of all those who sacrifice mobility for size: The flexible and fleet of foot will
almost always win, for they have more strategic options. The more gigantic

the enemy, the easier it is to induce collapse.
The need for formlessness becomes greater the older we get, as we
grow more likely to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a form.

The late-eighteenth-ceniniry court of France, as exemplified by MarieAntoinette, had become so hopelessly tied to a rigid formality that the
average Frenchman thought it a silly relic. This depreciation of 21 centuriesold institution was the first sign of a terminal disease, for it represented a
symbolic loosening of the people’s lies to monarchy. As the situation worsened, Marie-Antoinette and King Louis XVI grew only more rigid in their
adherence to the past—and quickened their path to the guillotine. King
Charles I of England reacted similarly to the tide of democratic change
brewing in England in the 1630s: He disbanded Parliament, and his court
rituals grew increasingly formal and distant. He wanted to return to an
older style of ruling, with adherence to all kinds of petty protocol. His
rigidity only heightened the desire for change. Soon, of course, he was
swept up in a devastating civil war, and eventually he lost his head to the
executioner’s axe.
As you get older, you must rely even less on the past Be vigilant lest
the form your character has taken makes you seem a relic. It is not a matter

of mimicking the fashions of youtl1—that is equally worthy of laughter.
Rather your mind must constantly adapt to each circumstance, even the inevitable change that the time has come to move over and let those of
younger age prepare for their ascendancy. Rigidity will only make you
look uncannily like a cadaver.
Never forget, though, that fonnlessuess is a strategic pose. It gives you
room

to create tactical surprises; as your enemies struggle to guess your

next move, they reveal their own strategy, putting them at a decided disad—

vantage. It keeps the initiative on your side, putting your enemies in the

position of never acting, constantly reacting. It foils their spying and intelligence. Remember: Formlessness is a tool. Never confuse it with a go~withthe~llow style, or with a religious resignation to the twists of fortune. You
use

formlessness, not because it creates inner harmony and peace, but be-

cause it will increase your

power.

Finally, learning to adapt to each new circumstance means seeing
events through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people
constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must throw out
the laws that others preach, and the books they write to tell you what to do,
and the sage advice of the elder. “The laws that govern circumstances are
abolished by new circumstances,” Napoleon wrote, which means that it is
up to you to gauge each new situation. Rely too much on other people’s
ideas and you end up taking a form not of your own making. Too much re«
spect for other people’s wisdom will make you depreciate your own. Be
brutal with the past, especially your own, and have no respect for the

philosophies that are foisted on you from outside.

REVERSAL

Using space to disperse and create an abstract pattern should not mean forsaking the concentration of your power when it is valuable to you. Form~
lessness makes your enemies hunt all over for you, scattering their own

forces, mental as well as physical. When you finally engage them, though,
hit them with a powerful, concentrated blow. That is how Mao succeeded

against the Nationalists: He broke their forces into small, isolated units,
which he then could easily overwhelm with a strong attack. The law of con—
centration prevailed.

When you play with formlessness, keep on top of the process, and
keep your longeterm strategy in mind. When you assume a form and go on
the attack, use concentration, speed, and power. As Man said, “When we
fight you, we make sure you can’t get away.”
